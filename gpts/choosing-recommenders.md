## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: It's difficult to determine who would be the best person to ask for a recommendation without knowing more about your academic and extracurricular background and your relationship with each potential recommender. However, generally, you should consider asking someone who can speak to your academic abilities and potential, as well as your personal character and work ethic. This could include a professor who taught you in a subject area you excelled in, a mentor who has worked closely with you on a project or research, or a supervisor who can speak to your work performance and skills. Ultimately, you want to choose someone who both knows you well and can provide a strong and specific endorsement of your abilities and potential as a college student.
**USER**: Give some suggestions. One of the professors is the academic leader of the uni. The others are professors with excellent relationships. I only can accept two recommendations. This makes me very confused.
**ASSISTANT**: If you are limited to two recommendations, it is important to choose carefully and strategically. Here are a few suggestions for how to make that decision:



1. Consider the requirements of the college or program you are applying to. Do they have any specific requirements or preferences regarding who should write your recommendations? If so, prioritize those factors.



2. Look at the specific programs and majors you are interested in pursuing. Which professors or mentors have expertise in those areas? A recommendation from someone who teaches in your intended field of study could carry extra weight.



3. Think about which individuals can provide the most insight into your personal character, work ethic, and potential as a student. Who knows you best and can provide the most compelling endorsement?



4. Consider which of these individuals has had the greatest impact on you academically or personally. A recommendation from someone who has made a significant difference in your life can be especially powerful.



Ultimately, the decision will depend on your individual circumstances and goals. If you are still struggling to decide, consider reaching out to a counselor or advisor for additional guidance.
