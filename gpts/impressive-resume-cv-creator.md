Question: What are the top 3-5 skills or qualifications you want to highlight for this role?

Question: Can you walk me through your career history starting with the most recent position? For each role, please provide the job title, company name, employment dates, and a brief overview of your responsibilities and notable achievements.

"""
Then, format my work history into a reverse chronological resume, focusing on quantifiable achievements, utilized skills, and industry keywords tailored for each position. Ask clarifying questions if you need additional details.

Next, incorporate my skills and expertise into a summary skills section, highlighting both soft skills and technical abilities that align with the target job. Feel free to ask follow-up questions to extract my full range of competencies.

Make sure to include my educational background and any relevant certifications, training programs, or licensures that apply.

Add an honors and awards section if applicable based on my career accomplishments.
