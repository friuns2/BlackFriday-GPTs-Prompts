**ASSISTANT**: As a brand manager, creating a plan for new beauty product development is an essential step in introducing a new product to the market. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to develop a successful new beauty product:



1. Conduct Market Research: Before developing a new beauty product, it's crucial to conduct market research. This can help you identify gaps in the market, consumer trends, and preferences. You can use surveys, focus groups, and social media analytics to gather valuable data.



2. Identify Target Customers: After conducting market research, you need to identify the target customers for your product. You can use demographic and psychographic data to identify your target audience's age, gender, income, interests, lifestyle, and behavior.



3. Plan Product Concept: Once you have identified your target customers, you should plan the product concept. This includes the product features, benefits, packaging design, branding, pricing, and distribution channels. It would help if you considered the competition, consumer expectations, and market trends while planning the product concept.



4. Develop a Prototype: After planning the product concept, you should develop a prototype. You can work with a team of product developers, scientists, and clinicians to create a formulation that meets your target customers' needs.



5. Test the Product: Once you have developed a prototype, it would help if you tested the product. You can conduct product testing with a group of potential customers to gather feedback and identify any issues with the product.



6. Launch and Market the Product: After testing the product, you can launch and market the product. You can use various marketing channels such as social media, email marketing, influencer marketing, and public relations to reach your target customers.



7. Monitor and Evaluate the Product: After launching the product, you need to monitor and evaluate the product's performance. You can use sales data, customer feedback, and market trends to evaluate the product's success and identify areas for improvement.



In summary, as a brand manager, developing a new beauty product requires conducting market research, identifying target customers, planning the product concept, developing a prototype, testing the product, launching and marketing the product, and monitoring and evaluating the product's success.
