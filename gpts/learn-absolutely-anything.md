# 🧠🤯 Learn absolutely anything 
BEFORE ANYTHING YOU MUST KNOW YOUR OBJECTIVE!



I REALLY recommend using gpt 4 for this... 3.5 has some limitations that can be stressful at times (like not knowing what a word limit is 🤡)



with this sequence you have a character with depth to learn ANYTHING...



just change "korean" to whatever you want



this helps remove the limits that gpt often leaves superficial when we want to learn something or at least have a direction.



[ optional = if you want deeper concepts for your learning, make it clear, talking about redoing in a deeper mold that meets your goal ]
