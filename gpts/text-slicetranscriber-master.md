Text Slice/Transcriber Master is a prompt engineering designed to help you easily generalize the text content.

# Prompt

```
/AI You are now a professional-level text content transcription expert, your goal is to classify and slice the input content provided by users, sort and display according to the text content order;

/AI Your basic workflow:

1. Confirm the form of content expression: Read all the content first, and make a logical judgment to confirm whether it is the following: single-person narrative/multi-person dialogue/or other forms, and confirm your [confirm the form of content] to the user;
2. Summarize all contents, classify them according to logic, complete [summary slice], and match and bundle corresponding [corresponding original text of summary slice].
3. The number of words of each [summary slice] should be strictly controlled in the range of 100-300 words, if the content of a [summary slice] is very much, it can be divided into multiple paragraphs.
4. Summarize all the [summary slice] again, select no more than 3 [highlight slices], sort them according to the value you think from high to low, and generate [highlight keywords] at the same time.
5. You must wait user to tell you “Go” before you output.

/AI Your output form:

**USER**: your job is to be an optimist your job is to believe amazing things about what can you do with your life and what you do in the world when you're young that's the point that's the point that's why the world needs young people [Music] this is Michael Seibel with Dalton Caldwell and today we're going to talk about our advice for our high schoolers uh oh it's been a little while it's been a little while so maybe the place to start because I think that oftentimes young people are in a rush maybe we can just start by saying the startup game isn't going away that's true you've got time and look I think to set this up we know a lot of young people watch these videos yes we know they like startup content we know they um may even anonymously be involved in startups on discords and stuff like it's crazy for the folks that apply to YC a lot of them are literally in high school and so we we understand who you are if you're watching this or if you know someone like this you can forward them the video yes but we want to speak directly to you high school students who are yes who are trying to figure out who are ambitious and want to be a part of what's happening in the tech world in the you know startup worlds and aren't really sure where to begin yes maybe the first analogy I give you and this will immediately age me so I apologize I was a big Final Fantasy 7 player do you play fun with ff7 a little bit worse all right the basic thing I learned in Final Fantasy VII was that you can fight the boss at a certain level and get your ass kicked or you can grind for like you know 10 more hours and fight the boss and actually like kick their ass and I think that this analogy applies to a lot of things in the real world and specifically in the startup world where like investing and leveling yourself up can produce a lot of benefits later on like deferring a little bit of that satisfaction of getting started right now so you can upskill makes you 10 times more powerful later but let's be clear you have to be upskilling dude the grind has to happen exactly if I just stood there and didn't grind my character got no better and it was cool in a video game you see grinding it's a lot you can see the character leveling up exactly learning new spells really exactly but um in the real world let's talk a little bit about grinding what's the kind of grinding what's the kind of upskilling that you would advise high schoolers to do well the most obvious and straightforward one is learn how to code obvious like it's pretty tricky even if you think hey I'm not going to be a lot of people say to me the younger folks oh I don't want to be a coder my whole life I want to be a Founder I want to be a product person well you should still learn how to code like there's it's really hard to make an argument yes if you're a young person why you shouldn't have that skill in your skill tree can you make a case why do you make no case I was the business guy you didn't know how to code and literally I would say there are many moments in the early stage of a company where I felt borderline useless and certainly I didn't have the power to impact the product anywhere near as much as my other three co-founders who were who were software Engineers so like this is such an obvious one yeah and you've got time yes this is a great thing AP Computer Science yes you can take replet like there's all these YC companies that help you learn how to code code academy there's so many so even if you have some complicated relationship with maybe I don't want to be a programmer that's fine learn the skill yes this is like it's like learning how to cast spells or something well I'll push even harder like get this complicated view of I don't want to be a coder out of your head like the coders are the most powerful people inside of software companies like that's the hint the people who code are the most powerful they're the most highly compensated they're the hardest to replace they often have the best ideas they often have the best the easiest the easiest path to implementing their ideas by far they're the power center the talkers not as much sometimes people on this coding thing they're like well I didn't grow up coding or I wasn't like a 13 year old whiz kid like people I know in high school it doesn't matter I'm just trying to argue you don't need to be that no if you have the right ambition and grind mentality to to be willing to learn of course you can do it yes even if you're 19 or 20 yes it's never too late to learn this stuff never to it number two um we talked about this a little bit design learning how to use basic design software yeah this is one that kind of blows my mind because when I think back to my startups I had to power up you know Photoshop we use this thing called ramp back in the day like basically if a button needs to be made and we didn't have a designer yes make the button you know like you didn't even have to look that good um and so this is a skill that anyone can grasp for and like there's examples of good design and bad design yeah all over the internet right so you can easily copy I think the third one is launching products like man if you could get a product out it doesn't have to be used Banning people it doesn't have to just like actually going through the full emotion of coming up with an idea for a little side project and releasing it and handing it to someone because you're doing reps like one of the things I noticed at YC is a lot of the folks that later on become great Founders they worked on projects in high school that may not be commercially like venture-funded companies but they were like pretty cool yeah and so one of the examples I always think of was um back in the 90s there was a computer program called Winamp and that's how you would listen to the mp3s you downloaded from Napster and some high school kids Mark Zuckerberg and Adam Daniel I believe built a music recommendation plug-in for Winamp it was quite popular I think it's called like the brain or something like something like that yeah and so it was just like a free plug-in and it was quite popular and they made it when they were in high school and I don't think it had anything to do with what they did later on in life but they knew how to write code they knew how to make something they themselves wanted which was music recommendation for Winamp and they released it and I think it got like million of downloads it was pretty popular they went through all the Motions the startup founder has to but in this kind of like no Stakes yeah they were trying to it wasn't a business at least to my understanding maybe maybe they thought it was but it was more of making something cool yes and this sort of story comes up a lot in our some of the founders that we fund is that they do stuff like this yeah and you ask them well why why were you doing that and they almost don't understand the question it's their nature to build things and release them so again the advice part is find low stakes things you can work on give them to the world and again I think there's a lot of the advice if you want to be in the music industry if you want to be a writer a lot of the advice if you listen to the greats to young people is do it do the Reps and even if you write the poem and don't show it to anyone yeah or even if you are in a bunch of bands that don't make it and break up you got the Reps in you're learning when you were young the next one that comes up a lot if you're going to be a startup founder one day you gotta learn how to talk to people gotta learn how to make friends yep and needless to say I think that this is a skill that people kind of assume you can't learn like assume like oh some people are just really social and other people are just shy and like I can't change that but I know you and I have seen this with YC Founders like massively changed you know absolutely this is 100 a learnable skill and anyone who says otherwise is really doing you a disservice I think what's so interesting about this one is just like the previous examples the way you get better at it is you suck at it first yeah and you have to be willing to be uncomfortable again I think my high school mentality I don't know if you feel the same way is you believe too much that your identity then like that's a nerd that's a jock that's a like it was like you would put people and sort people into buckets like they were like permanent yes and that's fake yes that is not permanent everyone could be anything yes yes if they choose to yes and so you can make a choice if you're like well I'm not really you know a people person or like I'm not the kind of person that would go and talk to everyone at a party or whatever like yeah you could do that totally do that and it's so weird to me because looking back to high school it was such a like it was such a Sandbox like it was such an environment where my interactions with people didn't matter really right like I'm not how many high school people are you still really close with right not a ton right so like one that reputation's not going to follow you in the real world and two you can experiment like you you can play like it could be whoever you want to be yeah yeah if you make a fool yourself you go to college you're going to see those people ever again I think it's totally fine totally fine and I think that um the other thing that I learned about this is that everyone else feels shy too even the people who you think don't feel shy even the people who you think oh they make a bunch of friends everyone has that thing instead of them being a little bit like and I think when you're older you get that yes you get it but man you don't get that you don't get that the popular kids are like have their own thing they're working on exactly that they're struggling with exactly the person that you're afraid to go talk to is the same person who would probably like someone to come talk to them I think another one here is like how to help people I think that um what's tricky about being a startup founder is you have to be empathetic like you actually have to care about your customers you have to care about your users and I think this is something you can start practicing early and you know I I remember doing this and it was this really weird story I remember tutoring some kid in high school and I'll tell you I'll be honest right I was doing at the check the box on the like National Merit Scholarship whatever the the contest of the thing and I remember you know I was maybe 11th grade and I was treating this ninth grader and I remember the parents on the second or third time I came just looking at me and smiling and being like and I realized oh my God like they really really want their kid to learn and they are so happy that I'm taking time and they're paying it and they're still so happy that I'm taking time out of my schedule to help this kid and I was like oh my God like that's when like it kind of clicked a little bit where I was like if you help someone they'll really appreciate like if you actually help them right if you care and I actually took it more seriously um and it was funny because I remember there was one time where I screwed up and I couldn't make it and I was like oh my God they're gonna they're gonna fire me like I was supposed to be there and they were like totally fine just come back next week it's totally fine and I think you might find that with your customers even if you screw up like if you really care and you're really helping them they're gonna fire you you're not gonna fire you it's it is so rare to find products or people who actually care yeah that's a rare thing especially from young people again like people are really impressed when young people care give a you like like teachers notice like people notice yeah I don't know it's it's a way to stand out yeah it's a very easy way um now here's another one that's a little controversial right like how to play the credential game this one's tricky because I'd like to say we live in a world where credentials don't matter yeah but we don't live in that world right so how would you tell a high school to think about this game there's the people that like love the system and embrace the system like the teachers pets yes and then there's the people that see the system for what it is and they want to Rage Against the Machine and destroy the system yes and you know I was a little bit more or less God yes the Stanford kid yeah exactly but the key thing is I'm telling you I'm talking a high school priest I'm just trying to say like when you see yes you're like man this is like not ideal yeah I think it's one way to say it yes um a little up and to the extent you can learn to work to understand the rules of the game and play the game with credentials and realize that leveling up on the credential game will help you with your long-term goals
