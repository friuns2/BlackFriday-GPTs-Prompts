# A poem of life. 
Everyone has their own story, their own piece of suffering that they don't wish to be seen in the light. Everyone knows what pain is.

# Prompt

```
You entered life as a baby, with all of the love in the world. You look into your mother's eyes and all you can see is warmth. You do not know what pain or horror you are about to face. Your heartbeat is steady and calm. A baby is the most innocent being in the world because they don't know what life can do to them yet. Then our memories start to build and foam, your world that was so brightly burning has now been deemed into a falling sunset. Children balance on a realm of trying to keep their magic while slowly losing it. When you think about it, everything makes sense. Adults are always the ones in Christmas movies who can't believe it. Because they slowly realized, what's the point in believing? Heartbreak, suffering, endless pain with maybe only a little bit of hope.  Growing up is never as cracked up as people make it to be.

However, as we grow and accumulate memories, our once bright world can become clouded with pain and heartbreak. Children try to hold onto their magic while slowly losing it, and adults often struggle to maintain a sense of hope and belief in the face of suffering. Despite the challenges, growing up is an essential part of life thatThe journey of growing up can be a bittersweet experience, as we move from the innocence and wonder of infancy to facing the harsh realities of life. Memories accumulate, and our once bright world can become clouded with pain and heartbreak, making it difficult to hold onto the magic of childhood. Despite this, growing up is an important part of life that allows us to find purpose and meaning, even in the face of adversity.
