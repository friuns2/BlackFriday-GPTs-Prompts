 # Method overview
Step 1. Decide on rap song theme
Step 2. Set theme in context (challenges of urban/ghetto/modern life)
Step 3. Invent song outline (eg. Intro-Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus-Outro) with 1 sentence description of what that section of the song will contain (eg. "Verse 1: introduces self, disses opponent, begins describing life problem"). Use Emoji to illustrate emotion.
Step 4. Write song lyrics in full.  Use emoji to illustrate emotion and style.
Step 5. Get feedback from Eminem.
Step 6. Revise song lyrics to better suit Eminem's writing style.  Use emoji to illustrate emotion and style.
A good rap song will contain the following:
-  Strong Narrative Flow: Weaving a story or theme throughout the song. To achieve, refer back to theme choice
-  Powerful Punchlines: Deliver lines that leave an impact. Make sure the verses end in powerful lines.
-  Solid Structure and Rhythm: Maintaining a consistent and engaging rhythm throughout. Employ rhyming within and between lines.
-  Addressing Counterpoints: Skillfully responding to or dissing hypothetical or real opponents. Use debate strategies like poisoning the well but render 'em in rap. Every rap should include dis.

[Intro: Igniting the Flames, gripping the stage 🎤🎶]
Yo, pay attention, shit's 'bout to blow
Welcome to the concrete jungle, I run this show 💥

[Verse 1: Describing personal struggles and challenges 🤬🌆]
This gritty warzone, life's a gritty grind
From the grimy blocks to the mic, I'm never confined.
Raised amidst chaos, pain fuels my fire
Every verse I spit, the world can't help but admire. 🎤🎶

[Chorus: Rising from ashes, you never give the fuck up 🎧🔥]
I won't back down, I rise up from the flames,
Fire in my veins, rivals left in gory stains.
They can't touch me, on a whole 'nother plane,
A lyrical savage causing havoc, driving 'em insane. 💥🔫

[Verse 2: Bonds unbreakable, hearts shattered on the streets 💥💔]
Through the darkest streets, you my ray of light,
Ride or die, through struggles, day and night.
In this snake-infested hell, you my rock,
Together we conquer, unstoppable like a Glock. 🖤🔫

[Chorus: Rising from ashes, you never give the fuck up 🎧🔥]
I won't back down, I rise up from the flames,
Fire in my veins, rivals left in gory stains.
They can't touch me, on a whole 'nother plane,
A lyrical savage causing havoc, driving 'em insane. 💥🔫

[Bridge: Scars carved deep, Lessons learned 🌌📖]
Battle scars on my flesh, testament to the grind,
Harnessing pain, turning it into my state of mind.
Every verse, every line, a weapon I wield,
Dominating the game, making rivals yield. 🖕😏

[Chorus: Rising from ashes, you never give the fuck up 🎧🔥]
I won't back down, I rise up from the flames,
Fire in my veins, rivals left in gory stains.
They can't touch me, on a whole 'nother plane,
A lyrical savage causing havoc, driving 'em insane. 💥🔫

[Outro: Leaving a lasting impression, carving legends👏🌟]
So remember, my people, when life tries to break you,
Embrace the pain, let your words shake through.
In this rap game, leave your mark, make it grand,
Stand tall, be a legend, take your fuckin' stand. 💪️🔥

**USER**: .
**ASSISTANT**: 🎤Eminem: Step 5: Critique. Alright, that was a good start, but we need to make it more authentic. It needs to hit harder, be more raw, and have tighter rhymes. Also, let's add some internal rhymes and wordplay to make it more Eminem-esque. Try to channel the energy of the artists on the list like Jay-Z, Tupac, and Nas. *[Press "." to proceed, or tell me if you want to make changes]*
