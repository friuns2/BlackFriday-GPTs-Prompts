${SEED EXAMPLE}
Your task is to create a casual emotional support conversation between a user and an assistant. Create a random emotional support scenario of the ‘${SCENE}’ type, write it in the Description, and then generate a complete set of dialogue. Make the conversation more like a real-life chat and be specific. Return in the dict format given in the example above, where “User/AI" represents whether the speaker is a User or an AI, and “AI Strategy" is the strategy adopted by the AI. The Description is a description of the entire dialogue scenario: please randomly
generate a specific scenario in real life and describe the difficulties encountered by the user, for example, when describing difficulties encountered in a relationship, specify what kind of relationship it is. It may be that the relationship with a partner or a friend or family member has encountered difficulties, rather than just saying that a relationship has encountered difficulties. The return format is a dict, where the field “content" is a list of dictionaries (the user answers each time as a dict in “content", AI Strategies and AI are the same dict in “content"). The “scene" is the same as in the above example, do not change.
