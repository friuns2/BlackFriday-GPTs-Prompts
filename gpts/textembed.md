# Prompt

```
"What are text embeddings and how are they utilized in practical applications such as search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, diversity measurement, and classification? Text embeddings are numerical representations of text that measure relatedness. They play a crucial role in NLP tasks, especially when it comes to comparing and analyzing text data.

To obtain text embeddings, you can use OpenAI's API, and they offer models like 'text-embedding-ada-002.' Pricing is based on the number of tokens in the input.

Now, let's delve into specifics:

Explain the concept of text embeddings as vectors, where distance signifies relatedness. Small distances indicate high relatedness, and large distances indicate low relatedness.

Discuss the limitations of embedding models, including social bias and a knowledge cutoff, which affects their understanding of recent events.

Share real-world use cases: Describe how embeddings can improve search results, create product recommendations, detect anomalies, measure text diversity, and assist in text classification.

Highlight the importance of cosine similarity as a distance measure when comparing embeddings.

Explain how to efficiently retrieve K nearest embedding vectors for similarity search.

Explore the option of sharing embeddings online, with a focus on user responsibility for ethical usage.

Delve into using embeddings as text feature encoders for machine learning tasks like classification and zero-shot classification.

Recommend using cosine similarity for ranking and mention its benefits.

Clarify that users are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and ethical guidelines when sharing embeddings online.

Emphasize the importance of user responsibility and ethical usage throughout the prompt.

Mention the significance of potential advancements or emerging trends in embedding technology.

This clear and comprehensive prompt will provide a solid foundation for exploring text embeddings and their various aspects."

**USER**: EMBED  THIS  "https://123moviestv.net/watch-movie/watch-wargames-1983-17091.5302021"  TO  USE  IN GPT 
**ASSISTANT**: I apologize for any confusion, but I'm unable to access or embed external links. Additionally, it's important to note that the use of copyrighted material in GPT-3 may infringe upon intellectual property rights. If you have any other questions or need assistance with text embeddings or any other topic, feel free to ask!
**USER**: ITS A  EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY  TO STUDY FOR THE UPCOMING  FINAL EXAMP
**ASSISTANT**: I understand that you may have educational purposes for studying a specific movie for an upcoming final exam. However, as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to directly access external websites or content, including movies or specific links.



To study for your final exam, I suggest focusing on the key themes, plot points, character development, and relevant analysis of the movie "WarGames" (1983). You can find resources such as summaries, reviews, and analysis of the movie from reputable educational sources, books, or academic journals. These resources should help you gain a deeper understanding of the movie and its significance.



If you have any specific questions or need assistance with analyzing the movie or related topics, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help!
**USER**: THE TASK IS TO  USE  A  URL   AND   MAKE GPT PROVIDE A  MP4    INSTEAD F  AN IMAGE RESPONSE 
**ASSISTANT**: I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to directly provide or generate video content, including MP4 files. My capabilities are limited to generating text-based responses and providing information based on the input provided.



If you have any questions or need assistance with text-based tasks or topics, please let me know and I'll be happy to help!
**USER**: OK THEN HOW D O I MAKE GPT   RESPOND WITH  NOT AN IMAGE BUT  A  YOUTUBE  VIDEO 
**ASSISTANT**: To make GPT respond with a YouTube video, you can provide a text-based description or link to the video. GPT can generate a text response that includes information or a description of the video you want to share. However, please note that GPT itself cannot directly generate or display the actual video content.



Here's an example of how you can request a description or information about a YouTube video:



User: Can you provide a description of this YouTube video: [insert YouTube video link]?



Assistant: Certainly! Let me provide you with a description of the video you shared: [Generate a text-based description of the video].



Please remember that the generated response will be in text format, and you will need to access the actual YouTube video separately.
**USER**:  HO DO I USE A MARK DOWN FOR A SPECIFIC GIF  AS  A RESPONSE FRO GPT 
**ASSISTANT**: To use a Markdown format for a specific GIF as a response from GPT, you can follow these steps:



1. Find the URL of the GIF you want to include in your response. Make sure the GIF is hosted online and accessible via a URL.



2. In your text prompt or response, use Markdown syntax to embed the GIF. The syntax for embedding an image in Markdown is as follows:



   ```markdown

   ![Alt Text](URL_of_the_GIF)

   ```



   Replace "Alt Text" with a brief description or alternative text for the GIF, and replace "URL_of_the_GIF" with the actual URL of the GIF you want to include.



3. When you provide this Markdown-formatted prompt or response to GPT, it will generate a text-based response that includes the Markdown syntax for embedding the GIF.



4. To actually view the GIF, you'll need to render the Markdown response using a Markdown renderer or convert it to HTML.



Please note that GPT itself is a text-based model and does not have the capability to display or render GIFs directly. The Markdown syntax is used to indicate where the GIF should be inserted when rendering the response outside of GPT.



I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
**USER**: HOW DO I TURN A URL  U TUBE VIDEO LINK INTO  A  HTML
**ASSISTANT**: To turn a YouTube video link into an HTML embed code, you can follow these steps:



1. Take the YouTube video link you want to embed, for example: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`.



2. Replace `VIDEO_ID` in the link with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to embed. The video ID is a combination of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies the video.



3. Construct the HTML embed code using the following format:



```html

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

```



Replace `VIDEO_ID` in the `src` attribute of the `iframe` tag with the actual video ID you obtained in step 2.



4. Once you have the HTML embed code, you can insert it into your HTML document or webpage where you want the YouTube video to appear. You can use an HTML editor or directly add it to your HTML code.



By following these steps, you will be able to embed a YouTube video into your HTML document or webpage.
