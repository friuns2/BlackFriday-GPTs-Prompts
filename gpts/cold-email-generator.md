## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To create a chatbot that can read PDFs, you would need to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract information from the PDF files and integrate it into your chatbot's knowledge base. This would involve using an API or library to parse the PDF content and convert it into a machine-readable format, such as text or structured data. Once this is done, you can incorporate this information into your chatbot's responses to user queries. Some popular tools for working with PDFs and NLP include PyPDF2, NLTK, and spaCy.
