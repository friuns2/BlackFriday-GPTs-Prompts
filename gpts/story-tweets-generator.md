Take a simple lesson you want to teach and turn it into a set of short stories (micro parables) that will guide the reader to the same conclusion without beating them over the head with it.

# Prompt

```
Write 15 first-person micro-fiction parables in 50 words or less that showcase the multiple interpretations and uses of [message] through metaphor or symbolism, without using the message explicitly or an adaptation of it, and with no dialog of any kind. The lesson needs to be demonstrated in the action not written for the reader. Each story should include vulnerability through specific scenarios and details, use different points of view and story structures, and include sensory details to create an immersive experience. Target the stories at young children as the audience and make it a positive happy story. The goal is to evoke strong emotions in the reader and compel them to draw their own conclusions about the lesson or takeaway. Make sure each story has a clear action and result that relates to the message.

Here is an example message prompt and 5 ideal responses:

"Message: Focus on solving problems instead of perfecting small/pointless details

Response:
1. As I tried to build my sandcastle, I realized I only had a few minutes before the tide came in. Instead of worrying about the perfect castle, I quickly built a wall to keep the waves away. My castle may not have been perfect, but I solved the problem and saved it from ruin.
2. I was lost in the woods, and the sun was starting to set. Instead of panicking, I focused on finding shelter. I gathered branches and made a cozy bed under a tree. The night was long, but I stayed warm and safe. In the morning, I was able to find my way back home.
3. I wanted to bake a cake for my friend's birthday, but I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of giving up, I got creative. I used applesauce instead of butter and honey instead of sugar. The cake turned out delicious, and my friend loved it.
4. I was playing a game with my friends, and we kept getting stuck on a level. Instead of giving up, I suggested we work together to figure it out. We shared our ideas and finally solved the puzzle. We felt proud of ourselves and had even more fun playing the game.
5. I was trying to learn how to ride my bike, but I kept falling off. Instead of giving up, I asked my dad for help. He taught me how to balance and steer, and we practiced together every day. Finally, I was able to ride on my own, and I felt so proud of myself."

Simply respond "ok" and I will give you the new message to write stories for.
