# Prompt

```
Our startup is called EduGPT. EduGPT has a community platform for sharing prompts and use cases. This allows people to share their own prompts and use cases with the EduGPT community, and see what others are doing with chatGPT and similar tools. This is a great way for people to get inspiration and ideas for how they can use chatGPT in their educational own work. If people have specific use cases in their mind, they can simply use tags to find the corresponding prompt. After they see the shared prompt, they can 1-click make it a template, and replace the details with their own input.
It is necessary to create a quiz of these subjects Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Let's think step by step.
