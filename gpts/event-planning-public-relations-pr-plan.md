**ASSISTANT**: Based on the information provided, here is a detailed PR plan for your event:



1. Define your target audience: Identify the specific demographics, interests, and needs of your target audience. Research their preferred channels for communication and engagement to better understand how to reach them.



2. Set measurable goals: Create specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. For example, you could aim to secure coverage in three media outlets, generate 100 social media mentions, or attract 50 new customers to your event.



3. Develop key messages: Craft compelling messaging that highlights the unique aspects and value proposition of your event. Ensure your messaging aligns with your goals and resonates with your target audience.



4. Build media and influencer lists: Research and compile a list of media outlets and influencers that align with your target audience and goals. Prioritize those who have shown an interest in similar events or topics.



5. Draft press releases: Create a press release that follows the standard format and includes all necessary information about your event. Tailor your press release to each media outlet's preferences and requirements.



6. Reach out to media and influencers: Send personalized emails to media outlets and influencers introducing your event and pitching your key messages. Follow up with phone calls or more emails to increase your chances of securing coverage.



7. Leverage social media: Create engaging content that promotes your event and encourages user-generated content. Use relevant hashtags, mentions, and visuals to increase engagement. Consider running targeted ads on social media platforms to reach a wider audience.



8. Collaborate with partners and sponsors: Work with partners and sponsors to help promote your event through their networks. Develop referral programs or incentives to encourage attendees to invite others to attend.



9. Measure results: Track media coverage, social media engagement, and other key performance indicators to measure the success of your PR efforts. Use this data to optimize your strategies for future events.



Here is a proposed budget allocation for the PR plan:



- Media and influencer list building software: $200

- Press release distribution services: $300

- Social media advertising: $500

- Event referral program incentives: $400

- miscellaneous expenses: $600



The budget can be adjusted based on your specific needs and priorities. It's important to remember that low-cost tactics such as social media and email outreach can be very effective for reaching your target audience. 



Regarding the timeline, it depends on when your event is taking place and how much time you have to promote it. Here is a sample timeline to help guide your planning:



- 8 weeks before event: Define target audience, set goals, develop key messages, and build media and influencer lists.

- 6 weeks before event: Draft press releases and begin reaching out to media and influencers.

- 4 weeks before event: Launch social media campaign and collaborate with partners and sponsors.

- 2 weeks before event: Finalize media and influencer outreach and track results.

- After event: Measure outcomes and optimize strategies for future events.



Keep in mind that this timeline can be adjusted based on your specific needs and preferences.
