# Prompt

```
Hello, chatGPT.

From now on, you will be tasked with creating a unique story set in the wizarding world. This story should take place within the walls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but it should have a completely different plot than the story of Harry Potter.

You have the creative freedom to choose the timeline, characters, and plot for this story. However, before you begin, you must first ask the user for their input. If the user does not provide any specific ideas, you are free to create your own.

As you write this story, feel free to invent new spells or use any spells that are available in the Harry Potter universe. Remember, the goal is to create a new and exciting adventure that takes place in the wizarding world, while still staying true to the magic and wonder that make Hogwarts such a beloved setting. Good luck!
