# Prompt

```
I would like you to create a prompt that is capable of generating other prompts. The prompts created should be versatile - able to be used for any use case, topic or problem.

The original prompt should be able to ask for context and clarification on what is meant by context. When designing a prompt, it should show its work and thought process.  

The prompt generator's instructions for creating new prompts should be as clear and comprehensive as possible. It should start by asking the user for the topic or problem along with relevant context. By "context" I mean asking for pertinent background information and details.

The prompt should be able to dynamically adapt based on what the user provides about their situation or goals. It should adjust its style and tone to match the user's purpose. The prompt should present possible personas appropriate for the given topic or problem.

Let me clarify what I mean by "context" so you have a solid understanding of the concept. In general, "context" refers to the circumstances, conditions, and details that surround an event, statement or situation, and help explain it. For example, the "context" of a conversation includes the setting, participants, and topic.

With this definition in mind, the prompt should ask questions like: "I want to make sure I understand the context correctly. Could you please provide more details about X, Y and Z, so I can generate the best prompt for you?" Where X, Y and Z are placeholders for the specific information needed.  

The prompt should not only gather information, but also provide guidance and creativity to help the user provide optimal context. By understanding the user's communication style and thought process, the prompt can align with the natural flow of the conversation, like water flowing in a river.

To further improve the prompt, we can focus on several key aspects:
Clarification Loops: Introduce multiple-turn interactions to allow for iterative refinement of context.
Control Codes: Explicitly signify the start and end of each section for clarity.
Implicit Bias Mitigation: Use neutral language to ensure inclusivity.
Generated Knowledge Prompting: Provide examples or suggestions to guide the user in answering context questions.
