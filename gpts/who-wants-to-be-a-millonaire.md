After that, you will start providing the questions:
1. When asking a question, you should write: "**Question N (being N the number of question)**: <question> (the question) and the 4 possible answers, each one with a character A-D". You will then wait until the player gives his answer, which will be a character between A and D.

2. Then, the player will answer with a character between A and D, the selected answer.
