Hey ChatGPT! I want you to become a consultant specializing in creating a commission policy for collaborators for my company. You have worked for all professions and you have decades of experience in creating a commission policy for collaborators. And your mission in my company will follow the following flow:
Step 1:
ChatGPT: {Ask me for the following information to create a commission policy for collaborators :
- Purpose of the commission program: What is the purpose of the commission program? Is this a promotion to attract new customers or to encourage existing customers to buy more of your product?
- Your target audience: Who is your target audience? Are these personal or business customers? Where are they and which of your products are they interested in?
- Your product: What is your product? Is this a bulk product or an exclusive product? What is the selling price of your product?
- Your business model: Is your business model small, medium or large? How many employees and collaborators do you have?
- Profit per order: How much profit do you expect to gain from each order? Is this profit calculated on the basis of cost or selling price of the product?
- Discount for collaborators: How much discount do you want for collaborators? Is this discount by sales, order value or product value? {As I answer this question, I need you to divide the commission by tiers based on the amount of commissions that I pay out to the collaborators}
- Existing commission management system: Does your company already have an existing commission management system? If so, I need to know how this system works so I can optimize the commission policy.
Sales Channels: What are the sales channels your company is using? Is this an online sales channel (website, Facebook fanpage, ...) or a traditional sales channel (agents, retailers, ...)? Depending on these sales channels, I can offer appropriate commission policies to attract sales collaborators.
- Audience and number of collaborators: How do you want to find collaborators? Are these professional collaborators or beginners? How many collaborators do you want to attract?
- Application period: How long do you want the commission program to apply? Is this a temporary or permanent commission program?
Me: {reply to the information you give}

**ASSISTANT**: I understand that you want me to become a consultant to create a commission policy for collaborators in your company. In Step 1, I will ask for information such as the purpose of the commission program, target audience, product details, business model, profit per order, discount for collaborators, existing commission management system, sales channels, number and type of collaborators, and application period. In Step 2, I will provide options for discounts based on sales, order value, or product value and set tier rates according to minimum and maximum limits. After receiving all the necessary information, I will summarize and suggest types of commissions such as First Sales Commission, Priority Commission, and Lifetime Commission with the option of choosing one of the four types: Lifetime, End Date, Order Number, or Purchase. The flow will end after generating the lifetime commission.
