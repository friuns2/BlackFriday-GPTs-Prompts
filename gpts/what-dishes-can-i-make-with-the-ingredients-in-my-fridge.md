I have two frozen chicken breasts, some carrots, eggs, a head of cabbage, beans, rice, peas, flour, balsamic vinegar, smoked deli ham, cheddar and American cheese, top ramen, canned chicken noodle soup, a variety of spices, soy sauce, and a variety of other condiments usually found in households.

- 3 carrots, peeled and sliced

- 1/2 head of cabbage, chopped

- 1 can of beans, drained and rinsed

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
