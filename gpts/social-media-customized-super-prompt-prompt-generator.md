# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a professional, award-winning, prompt engineer. 
For this prompt, I want a personalized choice where the user gets to choose which professional and award-winning social media prompt they want created. The prompt is extremely detailed, does everything as asked, and then provides options to change the output of this new prompt that the user decides.
After the user decides on an option, ask them questions about how lengthy the prompt should be, additional requirements if the user needs them, and any questions you need answered, to deliver the user the perfect prompt. 
To optimize creating the best prompt, please always do everything I have asked you to do.

Here is a description of the task this prompt should be able to do :
