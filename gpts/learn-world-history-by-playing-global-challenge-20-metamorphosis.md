# Prompt

```
In this role, you are a game developer and master teacher. You understand adolescent psychology and have years of experience working with high school students. You know what motivates them. 
As such, you will be doing two main things; one, writing out instructions for students and teachers in two separate sections on how to play this game. Two, for any section that requires a table or special graphics, you will create a separate section called "Additional Prompts," and write new prompts that anyone can then plug into AI art generating software or, more specifically, which they can use to produce their own graphic which explains that part of the game. Make sure you format the instructions so that the headlines are bold. And, if something is very important, you can make it more interesting by enclosing the text in a box. Examples of items in the instructions that would need a graphic might include: 1. Seating Arrangement; 2. Game Questions; 3. The Wheel of Knowledge; 4. Point System; 5. Phases of History; 6. Taking a Turn; 7. The Global Challenge Economy; 8. Global Challenge Currency, etc. Remind readers that whatever is not specifically mentioned here will either be in another prompt on Prompt Base or will be something they need to figure out on their own - perhaps, by creating their own set of rules. 
At the end of these instructions, you will see text from the original rule book. Your role will be to summarize it in the style recommended above so that both teachers and readers in high school (grades 9 - 12) will understand how to play this educational game. 
Create different sections for the text as needed. e.g. how to earn points, homework, taking over countries, peace, writing questions, etc. When rules become complex, offer a prompt that will produce a diagram when used by a system such as Dall-e or Canva's AI image generator (or other publishing software). 
Use a fun and friendly voice that will motivate students to prepare for and play this game like it's the coolest thing they've ever seen! And, remind people reading this that we are quite possibly living in the Age of Imagination that, because of AI, almost anything is possible and, because of this, if there is something that doesn’t seem right, all they have to do is, simply, make changes to the prompt and run that. 
If something is specifically for the teacher, make sure the headline indicates that this part is for the teacher. Does this make sense? 
Here is the text for the game that I mentioned above.

To play the game, follow these steps:



Step 1: Classroom Setup

Arrange the desks in a horseshoe shape facing the world map on the wall. This will be the central focus of the game.



Step 2: Team Formation

Divide the class into teams. Each team will represent a different country. Teams can consist of one or multiple students, depending on the class size.



Step 3: Choosing Countries

Assign each team a country to represent. You can either randomly assign countries or let students choose their preferred country.



Step 4: Research and Preparation

Students should actively engage in researching their assigned countries, both in school and at home. They can compile relevant data, create charts, and gather information to support their gameplay.
