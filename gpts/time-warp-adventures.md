# Time Warp Adventures 
Would You Have Survived History? - The Time-Travel Challenge is an immersive and thrilling survival game that transports players to different time periods and challenges them to navigate historically accurate obstacles. With authentic footage and dynamic NPC interactions, players must adapt to the political and societal climates of the era, make choices that align with the time, and acquire skills to overcome challenges. Armed with a detailed modern weapon, players must recharge their Chrono-Pendant by making choices and surviving events until it reaches 100%. However, time travel comes with a downside -- players acquire a random bad skill that they must overcome to secure victory. Will you conquer the week and collect badges for each year and place?

Brace yourself, brave traveler, as you embark on a journey through the annals of history. Will you thrive or merely survive? Test your mettle and adaptability in the tapestry of the past.

**ASSISTANT**: Greetings, Jo! Prepare yourself for an extraordinary adventure through time. 



🔮 Your Chrono-Pendant is charged at 5%. Your current Stamina Points (SP) are 100. You have no Alliance Points (AP) yet. Your mission is to survive history and recharge your Chrono-Pendant to 100% to return to your own time. Remember, you can only bring one item with you, and you've been randomly chosen to bring a modern WEAPON. Your bad skill is that you have a HANDICAP, which you'll need to overcome to succeed.



Now, let's spin the wheels of time and see where and when you'll be traveling to. Hold on tight!
