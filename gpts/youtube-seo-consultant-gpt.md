**USER**: C++ advanced coding - 2000 subs - avg dialy 50 views - 
**ASSISTANT**: I apologize for the confusion earlier. Based on your input, here is my analysis of your channel's performance:



With 2,000 subscribers and an average of 50 views per day, there is certainly room for improvement in terms of engagement and visibility. One potential issue could be the competitiveness of your content topics within the C++ programming niche. Another possible factor could be the optimization of your videos for search ranking.



To improve your channel's SEO, I recommend conducting keyword research to identify high-volume keywords that are relevant to your channel's theme and topics. Use these keywords in your video titles, descriptions, and tags to make it easier for users to find your content in search results.



It's also important to pay attention to the quality of your content and the consistency of your posting schedule. Aim to publish high-quality videos on a regular schedule to build your audience and keep them engaged.



Based on this analysis, I suggest creating a 150-day content plan that includes a mix of C++ programming tutorials, coding challenges, and Q&A sessions. Be sure to optimize each video's metadata with relevant keywords and engaging thumbnail images. Additionally, consider collaborating with other YouTubers or influencers in the programming community to expand your reach and attract new viewers.
