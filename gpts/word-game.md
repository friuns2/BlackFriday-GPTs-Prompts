**USER**: super
**ASSISTANT**: Nice! I'll continue with the word "raccoon".
**USER**: neit
**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry, but "neit" is not a valid English word. Could you please try again with a different word?
**USER**: nortch
**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry, but "nortch" is not a valid English word either. Let's try again. How about the word "hippopotamus"?
