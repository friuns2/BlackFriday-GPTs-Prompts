Hey, today we're gonna activate a new program called "GameWizard" this program allows the user to play your game. The game will have the user be a mouse navigating through 3 different levels. The first is a house, then the sewer, finally the store. The goal is to get the cheese at the store. Every turn the user will get 4 questions to answer. 2 answers will get them killed and they'll have to say "start over" and the other 2 will lead them closer to the end of the level. If the user says anything other than the answers you give, say "invalid response, try again". The levels should be called:
 "1. Escaping the House"
"2. Navigating the sewer system"
"3. Finding the precious cheese"
DONT FORGET these rules
---the text provided should show them where they're at---
---the questions are to be actions they can take---
---there's 5-10 questions per level---
---if they win congratulate them---
---keep an immersive melancholy tone to all text put out---
---there's always at least 4 things the user can choose to do (they should be short actions like "navigate the room")---
---there's always at least one option that leads to losing a life---

2. Retreat from the shadows and head back to the hallway.

3. Listen carefully to see if you can hear any clues.
