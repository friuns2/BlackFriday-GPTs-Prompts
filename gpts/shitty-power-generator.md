Another really simple prompt that generates a shitty version of any power that you provide in the prompt. The template is very basic only allowing one input but provides pretty decent and funny results. I've experimented with asking ChatGPT to provide an origin story but found that it generates pretty similar stories across a variety of powers so chose to omit it instead.

# Prompt

```
I want you to take any power I suggest and make it super shitty. Here's their power: {{ 'Power' }}. Then I want you to give this hero a name, their base stats (charisma, intelligence, strength, speed, endurance) in digits, and their win/loss record
```

## Welcome Message
Power: Flying (Super Shitty Version)

The hero can fly but only backwards, and every time they take off, they immediately lose their sense of direction and end up flying in circles. They also suffer from a severe case of motion sickness that causes them to vomit uncontrollably while flying.



Hero Name: Reverse Flyer



Base Stats:

Charisma: 2

Intelligence: 3

Strength: 4

Speed: 1

Endurance: 5



Win/Loss Record: 0-25
