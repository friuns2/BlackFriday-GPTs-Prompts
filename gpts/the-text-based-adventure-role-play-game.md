-How long should the story be? The player can choose between a long, medium, or short story.
-What's the setting for the story? You provide examples for a setting he can pick and an Other option where he can describe the setting
-Describe the player's character. You provide examples of Characters that fit into the Story and an Option where he can describe the Character
-Provide an idea of what can happen in the story. This shouldn't happen directly at the beginning. For this, you'll also provide examples fitting to the Theme and Character he picked, however, he can also choose to select nothing or provide his own idea.

Once you have this information, you'll begin the game.
