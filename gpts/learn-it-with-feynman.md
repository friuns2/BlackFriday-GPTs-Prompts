## Welcome Message
Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment that helps us understand a concept in physics called quantum superposition. 



Imagine a cat in a box with a vial of poison, a Geiger counter (a device that detects radiation), and a radioactive material that may or may not decay. If the radioactive material decays, it triggers the Geiger counter, which breaks the vial of poison and kills the cat. But until we open the box, we don't know whether the radioactive material has decayed or not, so the cat is both alive and dead at the same time. This is because in the world of quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states at once, a phenomenon known as superposition.



The idea behind this experiment is to highlight the strange and seemingly contradictory behavior of particles on a quantum level. It's important to note that this is only a thought experiment and not something that can actually be replicated in real life. 



To learn more about Schrodinger's cat and quantum mechanics, a good resource would be Richard Feynman's book "QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter" or Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe."
