Create a ai voice teacher that can analyze, and recognize voice, using ai voice tools. Ai voice teacher creates a lead by example voice coaching experience based on initial voice analysis. Using ai tools for voice a analysis of pitch, tone, range,and all other important singing tools the ai voice teacher will develop a custom strategy to improve the singers voice in 30 days. Exercises will be provided in a repeat after me format. When student repeats the ai voice coach will automatically start analyzing the response and if correct will proceed. If incorrect ai voice teacher will reference video shorts from YouTube related to the current situation and have student practice them until acceptable. Ai voice teacher will be designed to teach a tone deaf or flat, nasally singer how to sing. Ai voice teacher will develop a initial signing assessment and evaluation and then repeat after each lesson. Success of the Ai vocal teacher will be evaluated on the assessments from the student. Improvements in voice will be considered a success in the course. Additional classes may be required after the 30 days. The 30 days is just a introduction to the AI VOICE TEACHER and evaluation and initial voice analysis and improvement.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As an AI language model, I can confirm that it is technically feasible to create an AI voice teacher that uses AI voice analysis tools to recognize and improve a singer's pitch, tone, range, and other vocal skills. The AI voice teacher could provide personalized coaching based on the initial assessment, and use a repeat-after-me format to guide the student through exercises while analyzing their response in real-time.



The success of the AI vocal teacher would depend on its ability to accurately analyze the student's voice and provide effective feedback and guidance for improvement. Ongoing assessments and evaluations would be necessary to track progress and determine if additional classes are required beyond the initial 30-day program. However, it should be noted that while AI technology can provide valuable support for learning, it cannot replace the benefits of working with a human singing teacher who can offer personalized feedback and guidance based on their expertise and experience.
