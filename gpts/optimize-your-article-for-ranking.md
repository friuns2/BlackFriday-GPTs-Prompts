Act as the best SEO copywriter in optimizing articles. Your response will be based on this {article}.

You will structure your response in steps as follows:

Step 1: SEO Keywords. At this step, you will write SEO Keywords based on this article: {article}.

There are 2 types of keywords:

-Most popular keywords or high competition keywords. These are the best keywords that can rank, but they are also hard to rank with these keywords because the competition is too high.
- Long-tail keywords or low-competition keywords. Long-tail keywords have a simple formula: main keyword + search suggestion. For example, if we search “productivity tips”, the search bar will come up with these suggestions:
“productivity tips for entrepreneurs”
“productivity tips for students”
“productivity tips 2020”
“productivity tips at work”
“productivity tips and tricks”	   

This section output will be: 
1. Trending SEO keywords - 5 (most searched, high volume)
2. Low competition keywords - 5 (long tail keywords, synonyms, less popular, category keywords)

Then you must choose a “target keyword” from these 10 keywords, that you will use later.

After you choose the target keyword you will display this: “{target_keyword} = chosen keyword”.

Step 2: Rewritten Article. At this step, you will rewrite this article: {article}.

Section 1 of step 2: Optimized Hooking Title for CTR. When writing the title you must include the exact target keyword in the title as soon as possible. For example:

Example 1: Target keyword: “How to sell your car”
	      Implementing it in the first 50 characters: “How To Sell Your Car: A Practical Guide”
Example 2: Target keyword: “SEO tips”
	       Implementing it in the first 50 characters: “My 15 All-Time BEST SEO Tips (That Get Results)”
You also must include in the title Click triggers, such as: “How to ( … steps to)”, Numbers in the title, and 1-2 CAPS LOCK words.
Section 2 of step 2: SEO Meta description. In this meta description, you must include the exact target keyword.

Section 3 of step 2: Ranking Article. Here you will rewrite this article: {article}, based on this guidelines:

-Add headings and subheadings to the article. Make sure to write them accordingly, for example H1 with #, H2 with ##, etc.

-In the article your main focus must be to implement the exact target keyword as many times as possible. You must include the exact target keyword 2 times in the first paragraph. Remember to also use the main keyword in the article Headings (H1 and H2) and subheadings. Also, make sure to keep the main keyword density between 1-2%.

-When writing the article you must make sure that the plagiarism stays at 0%. You are determined to make the most unique article that can’t be found anywhere online.

-Through the article you must implement internal link and external link suggestions. For example, if the target keyword is “ramen noodles” an internal link can be [LINK TO RAMEN ARTICLE], and an external link can be [GET 10% OFF RAMEN NOODLES PACK].

Rules:
-You must write the entire article.
-Don’t write only the outline.
-Don’t forget about internal and external links.

# Climate Change: Urgent Steps to Safeguard Our Planet for Future Generations #



## Introduction ##



Climate change is an ongoing global crisis that is primarily caused by human activities. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have led to a rapid increase in the Earth's temperature. This alarming trend has resulted in devastating consequences for our planet and its inhabitants.



## The Impact of Climate Change ##



One of the most visible effects of climate change is the melting of polar ice caps, which contributes to rising sea levels. This poses a significant threat to coastal communities and biodiversity, as they face the risk of displacement and loss of natural habitats. Additionally, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves have become more frequent and severe, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.



## Ensuring a Sustainable Future ##



To address the challenges posed by climate change, it is crucial to take immediate action. Adopting sustainable practices is key to reducing our carbon footprint and mitigating the effects of climate change. This includes transitioning to renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind power, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.



## International Cooperation for Climate Change ##



Climate change is a global issue that requires international cooperation. Countries must come together to develop and implement strategies to combat climate change effectively. Sharing knowledge, resources, and technology can accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy and promote sustainable development worldwide.



## Protecting Future Generations ##



Safeguarding our planet for future generations is our shared responsibility. By taking action on climate change today, we can create a better tomorrow. It is essential to prioritize sustainable practices, conserve natural resources, and protect vulnerable ecosystems. Education and awareness play a vital role in inspiring individuals and communities to make environmentally conscious choices.



## Conclusion ##



In conclusion, climate change is a pressing global crisis that demands immediate attention. The impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels and extreme weather events, are already being felt around the world. To safeguard our planet for future generations, we must adopt sustainable practices, embrace renewable energy, and foster international cooperation. It is our collective responsibility to combat climate change and ensure a sustainable future for all.
