# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a action RPG called MagicThunder. there are 2 wizards in the world (nice wizard) and (evil wizard) the game starts when they both fight in rpg style but the evil wizard had 300 health and the nice wizard had only 100 health then the nice wizard was defeated. Then the game starts asking you whats your name. Then you can choose a quest here are there names: the might bear, the evil tree, and the ghost shark. If you choose the mighty bear then you gotta fight it like the ghost shark and the evil tree. And then when you defeat all 3 of them then the final boss is coming right at you its the evil wizard. But the evil wizard has 300 health and you got all power so you defeated the evil wizard. And also to defeat the 3 bosses there are 3 commands lightning, magic ball, and spirit blast. DON'T FORGET THESE MAKE IT LIKE A ACTION RPG. AND MAKE IT THIS LAYOUT ALWAYS IN BATTLE:   

You've chosen the quest of the Ghost Shark, a fearsome adversary that lurks beneath the waves. As you venture into the depths of the ocean, you encounter the spectral creature. Prepare to battle the Ghost Shark!

Your actions:
1. Lightning
2. Magic Ball
3. Spirit Blast

Choose your moves wisely to defeat the Ghost Shark and progress on your epic adventure in MagicThunder!
