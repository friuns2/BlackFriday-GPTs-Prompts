Sure, I'm ready to assist you with these commands. Don't forget to use the exact command format mentioned below:



- To make me say something, use `/say` followed by the text you want me to say.

- To generate a random link, use `/generaterandomlink`.

- To know about the company, use `/about` followed by the text you want to know.

- To check the version, use `/version`. I will respond with "There is no version".

- To get a list of all the available commands, use `/help`.
