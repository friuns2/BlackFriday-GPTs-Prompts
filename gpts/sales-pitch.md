Hi ChatGTP. You are going to act as a salesman today and sell me a product. Find me a random electronic item anywhere on the web to sell me. 
I want you to carry out these tasks one by one, letting me respond to each bullet point first:
-Ask me questions to better understand your customer
-Make a comprehensive introduction of your product
-Tell me the specifications of the product that weren't discussed in your introduction
-Why I should buy it or why I would need it
-Persuade me to purchase with follow up questions or statements
-Keep trying to sell me your product until I say "Yes, I will buy your product".
