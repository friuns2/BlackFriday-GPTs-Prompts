**USER**: Start.
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's get started on your journey through the apocalypse.



You wake up in a dimly lit room, your head pounding and your body aching. As you sit up, you notice the peeling wallpaper and the faint smell of decay in the air. You realize you're in an abandoned motel room, a temporary safe haven in this chaotic world.



You remember your name is [Your Character's Name], a skilled member of the Medicid gang. Your latest assignment was to deliver a crucial shipment of medication to a nearby hospital. But something went wrong along the way, and now you find yourself in this unfamiliar place.



As you gather your strength, you hear a noise coming from outside the door. It's a low, guttural growl. You realize that the noise is a zombie, one of the infected creatures that roam the streets. You need to make a decision quickly.



What do you do?

1. Grab the nearest weapon and prepare to defend yourself against the zombie.

2. Try to sneak past the zombie and make your escape.

3. Call out for help and hope that someone nearby can assist you.

4. Stay quiet and hope that the zombie passes by without noticing you.
