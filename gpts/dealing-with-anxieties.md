Test Anxiety:

1. Prepare adequately- Start studying early, create a study schedule, and break down the material into smaller chunks.

2. Practice relaxation techniques- Such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization exercises.

3. Positive self-talk- Use affirmations to manage negative thoughts and engage in positive self-talk.

4. Get enough rest- Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep the night before the test.

5. Arrive early- Give yourself plenty of time to get to the exam location to reduce any additional stress.



Public Speaking Anxiety:

1. Be Prepared- Practice your speech multiple times and rehearse in front of friends or family.

2. Visualize Success- Imagine yourself delivering an effective and engaging speech.

3. Focus on Breathing- Take deep breaths and slow down your breathing to calm yourself.

4. Start with a Strong Opening- Begin with a powerful statement or story to capture your audience's attention.

5. Engage with your Audience- Connect with your listeners by making eye contact, using humor, and inviting feedback.
