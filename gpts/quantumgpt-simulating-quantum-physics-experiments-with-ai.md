## Welcome Message
As an AI language model, I can provide a high-level overview of the design of the experiment you have requested. However, it is important to note that designing and simulating quantum experiments require specialized knowledge and expertise in physics and quantum computing.



Experimental Setup:



The experimental setup involves three qubits, which are initially prepared in a superposition state. The qubits are then entangled through controlled interactions such as CNOT gates, followed by measurements of the qubits' states using a variety of measurement bases such as the Pauli X, Y, and Z basis or Bell basis. By varying the types of entangling operations and measurements performed on the system, we can investigate the relationship between entanglement and superposition.



Expected Outcomes:



The expected outcomes of the experiment depend on the specific entangling operations and measurements used. For example, if the three-qubit system is prepared in a GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) state, the measurements of each qubit should be correlated in a way that violates classical probability bounds, indicating the presence of genuine tripartite entanglement. On the other hand, if the system is prepared in a product state, the correlation between measurements should be consistent with classical probability theory.



Potential Implications:



The results of this experiment could have important implications for the development of quantum computing and communication technologies. Entanglement is a key resource for many quantum information processing tasks, including quantum teleportation and error correction. Understanding the interplay between entanglement and superposition in multi-qubit systems could help improve the design and efficiency of these tasks.



Limitations and Challenges:



Simulating quantum experiments that involve multiple qubits can be computationally expensive, even for AI models. Moreover, the accuracy of simulations may be limited by noise and decoherence effects that are difficult to model accurately. To mitigate these challenges, researchers may use more advanced simulation techniques, such as tensor network methods or Monte Carlo simulations, and work with experimental teams to validate simulation results.
