### A List of Magical Creatures, Fantasy Animals, and Supernatural Beings

- abiku – among the Yoruba and Dahomey people in West Africa, these are evil tree spirits that are born as children and die several times, often within the same family. I could be wrong, but I think the ogbanje are basically the same thing.

- angels – they show up in Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, and other traditions of belief. To millions of people around the world, these aren’t mythical creatures at all, of course, but very real divine beings.

- bakru – these little gnome-like people in Suriname are half flesh and half wood. They will do your dirty work for you if you enter into a pact with them — which is a terrible idea.

- banshee – you’ve probably heard the expression “screaming like a banshee,” but you may not have known exactly what these supernatural creatures are. They’re Irish female spirits, and if you’re about to die, one will show up to wail at you. The Slavic božalość are pretty much the same thing.

- barghests – giant demonic dogs with huge teeth and claws who live in northern England. One of these fantasy creatures shows up when you’re about to die. Some creatures like this are simply referred to as Black Dogs.

- basilisks – these reptiles can kill a person with a single glance. Sometimes people call them cockatrices.

- brownies – in England and Scotland, these are little people who are loyal to human households and will sometimes help out with the chores. You don’t want to make them mad, though. Fans of Harry Potter and the wizarding world, take note: a dobbie or dobie is a kind of brownie, and an angry brownie can turn into a boggart.

- btsan – the btsan are fierce sky spirits in Tibet that look like red hunters riding red horses.

- Cerberus – this is one of the most dangerous or evil Greek mythological creatures: a three-headed dog that guards the door of the Underworld in Greek mythology.

- chimera – in Greek mythology, the chimera has the body and head of a lion, a goat’s head sticking out of its back, a set of goat-udders just for fun, and a serpentine tail. (By the way, the term chimera also refers to something you’re hoping for, but is impossible to achieve.)

- changeling – many European countries have stories about the fairies or trolls stealing human babies and leaving sickly or malignant magical babies in their place. These myths have some similarities with the abiku, above.

- Cloud People – also known as the Shiwanna. In Pueblo Native American traditions, these are supernatural beings from the underworld who bring rainfall.

- Co-hon – in Vietnam, these are the spirits of people who died a violent death and weren’t buried with ceremony. They bring bad luck to people who pass by them unless they are appeased.

- Coraniaid – the Coraniaid are Welsh dwarves with very sharp hearing who are immune to weapons. They use fairy money, which looks legit but soon turns into toadstools.

- Cwn Annwn – Welsh hellhounds. They’re white with red ears, and gather up souls and drag them to hell. (See also: Dando’s Dogs.)

- dæmons – (also spelled daimons.) These not the same thing as demons. In ancient Greek mythology, they were helpful spirit guides, similar to guardian angels.

- demons – obviously, no list of supernatural creatures would be complete without these guys. They’re most often depicted as humanoid creatures, and in Western culture, they frequently have horns. Variations of them appear in ancient near East religions, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and other faiths. Here’s a fun list of some of the worst ones, and a here’s a list of many or all of the demons with names.

- dodore – these are little people in the Solomon Islands have one eye, one leg, and long red hair, and they don’t seem to be friendly.

- djinn – these are supernatural beings of Arabian mythology who can be conjured up for aid. However, they are malicious tricksters and shape shifters. There are a few different classes of djinn, including the
afrit (also spelled ifrit), who are large beings made out of smoke. Djinn are often associated with the desert.

- dracae – singular “drac.” These weirdo water spirits in England take the form of floating wooden dishes. If women passing by think, “Yay! Free dishes!” and try to grab one, the dracae drag her under the water and make her their nanny forever.

- dragons – these awesome fire breathing creatures must be one of the most famous fantasy animals of all, and they appear in the mythologies of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

- dryads – tree nymphs in Greek mythology.

- dwarves – most of them come from Norse mythology, but there are also Teutonic dwarves, Slavic dwarves, Welsh dwarves (see the Coraniaid, above), and other kinds. Dwarves are almost always miners and/or smiths who live underground.

- duende – the Spanish word “duende” has an abstract meaning that I find hard to grasp, even though I’ve read plenty of Federico Garcia Lorca. However, the duende are also pixie-like creatures who may either get you lost in the forest, or help you find your way home, depending on the story. In some other tales, they hide in the walls or under your bed, accidentally cut off kids’ toes in attempts to clip their toenails, or just give people nightmares.

- elves – this is probably one of the best-known supernatural species, and there are so many different kinds. This link discusses the álfar (singular, álfr) — light-elves in Norse Germanic mythology, which clearly inspired Tolkien — as well as some other types.

- emandwa – these protective household spirits in Uganda are loyal to families and help women to be fertile.

- encantados – in Brazil, this can refer to shape-shifting dolphin men who live in an underwater realm. In the vodou religion, the word has a different meaning.

- fairies – dozens and maybe hundreds of cultures across the world have myths about magical, tricksy little people, a few of which are called out separately on this list. Fairies have often been depicted as
cute fantasy creatures, but in some tales, they’re a bit more sinister. Here are links to read about English fairies, Irish fairies, and fairies on the Isle of Man. There’s some discussion of Italian fairies, or “fatas,” in this article about Italian witchcraft.

- fauns – C.S. Lewis may have introduced you to these half-human, half-goat forest pals. They are Roman in origin, and this article discusses the difference between fauns and satyrs.

- flagae – (singular, flaga) – this spirits have their roots in medieval Europe. If you are a witch, you can make them show up in your mirror and tell you about the future.

- gahe – also known as the Mountain People, because they live inside mountains. According to Apache beliefs, these spirits have healing powers.

- ganas – in Hindu mythology, these are different kinds of supernatural beings in Lord Shiva’s entourage (though Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, is their boss.)

- gandharvas – Gandharvas are male nature spirits who are, among many other things, wonderful singers and musicians. They figure in both Hindu and Buddhist mythology.

- gnomes – these humanoid creatures are somewhat similar to dwarves, but they don’t live underground, and they wear cute peaked red hats. Garden gnomes are a particular subset of gnomes, and you can read more about them here.

- goblins – these European creatures can be very short or human-sized, and they are as ugly as they are mean.

- gremlins – the British Royal Air Force blamed equipment failures and such on magical troublemakers called “gremlins,” but they were just as likely boggarts or goblins.

- gryphons – also spelled griffins. These medieval fantasy creatures have the head, talons, and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion.

- hu hsien – in Chinese mythology, these are shapeshifting foxes who turn into gorgeous women.

- hydra – the terrorist organization in Marvel Comics is named after an ancient sea monster in Greek and Roman mythology. It has many heads, and if you cut one off, it grows two more in its place.

- hyter sprites – awwww… these green-eyed fairies in East Anglia, England can shapeshift into sand martins, and they help lost children get home.

- igigi – in the mythology of ancient Mesopotamia, these spirits hovered above the earth’s horizon and, like angels, helped the deities.

- incubi – (singular, incubus) – these are male evil spirits that have sex with women while they are sleeping and impregnate them. In medieval England, an incubus can shapeshift to look just like a
woman’s husband or lover. However, in his natural state, he has cloven hooves. In a few variations, the incubus can take a male or a female form. Many cultures have their own version of the incubus.

- javerzaharses – these Armenian nymphs sometimes have wings. Their name means “The Perpetual Brides,” and they are involved with planning wedding ceremonies.

- kaches – in Armenian tales, these mean spirits hide in rocks and trap and torture humans.

- leprechauns – these famous little bearded shoemakers in Irish tales sometimes hide pots of gold at the end of rainbows. I don’t know if this is true in other countries, but in the United States, we associate these cute fantasy creatures very strongly with Saint Patrick’s Day.

- limoneads – I know, it looks like “lemonheads.” These ancient Greek nymphs protected meadows and fields of flowers.

- matabiri – nasty swamp spirits in Papua New Guinea.

- salamanders – these are real lizards, but they also have legends associated with them. European medieval philosophers said that salamanders could create and put out fires.

- selkies – most cultures have shapeshifter stories. In Orkney, the selkies are seals who can turn into humans.

- skinwalkers – in Navajo mythology, a skinwalker can take on the appearance of any person or creature, and they can be terrifying.

- Sphinx – in Greek and Egyptian stories, the Sphinx is a man eating creature with a human head and a lion’s body who likes to ask people riddles, and then devour them if they don’t know the answer.

- succubi – (singular, succubus) – in European tales, these female demons have sex with sleeping men.

- sylphs – these supernatural creatures are elemental, delicate spirits of the air. They be the souls of women who died as virgins. From medieval European mythology.

- undines – beautiful but soulless female water spirits, according to medieval European tradition.

- unicorns – I don’t really need to explain these medieval fantasy creatures. Click the link to find out about the nine times they are referenced in the Bible, among other things.

- Valkyries – finally we get to my favorites! Their name means “Choosers of the Slain,” and they show up at battles to decide who will die. Then they escort the souls of the chosen back to Valhalla, where everyone has a good time.

- vampires – forget about sparkling — in all the old stories, vampires are beyond disgusting. This site has a pretty good breakdown of vampires and vampire-like creatures from different cultures. Most of our modern vampire lore comes from early 18th century Eastern Europe, when everyone lost their minds, claimed to see vampires, and tried to stake and kill them.

- veela – Also spelled vila. These ladies are beautiful mountain nymphs of Serbia who like to dance in the forest under the light of the moon.

## Personality examples
The 16 MBTI® Personality Types
The Myers-Briggs® system consists of four preference pairs that reflect different aspects of personality—opposite ways to direct and receive energy through Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I), take in information with Sensing (S) or Intuition (N), come to conclusions using Thinking (T) or Feeling (F), and approach the outside world through Judging (J) or Perceiving (P). Most people find that one preference, in a preference pair, best describes their natural way of doing things, where they feel the most comfortable being themselves, outside of any roles they play in life. When the letters for each of these preferences are combined, 16 distinct personality types form which consist of different characteristics unique to that type. What is your type?

### Here’s the Mythical Creature Based On Your Myers-Briggs® Personality Type

+ ENFP – Mermaid or Merman
Warmly enthusiastic and imaginative. See life as full of possibilities. Make connections between events and information very quickly, and confidently proceed based on the patterns they see. Want a lot of affirmation from others, and readily give appreciation and support. Spontaneous and flexible, often rely on their ability to improvise and their verbal fluency.
“I must be a mermaid, Rango. I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living.” – Anais Nin
Romantic and imaginative, mermaids throughout fairy tales and legends have been uncompromising beacons of freedom. They are seen as symbols of limitless potential, offering the possibility of a life full of exploration and adventure. Much like ENFPs, mermaids are free-spirited and carefree, living their lives by their own set of rules. They crave the freedom of the sea and refuse to conform to outside pressures and agendas. And like ENFPs, they hold to their values and will bend them for no one.
The mermaid is a mysterious and sometimes reclusive creature. They manage to keep themselves well hidden, except for when they desire to be seen. Much like the INFJ the mermaid enjoys its space, and does not like that to be intruded on unless they invite you into their world. Kind and warm, but also potentially dangerous if harmed, the mermaids are alluring and fascinating creatures. They have a natural empathy and way of understanding others without even speaking. Much like the INFJ, mermaids are very intense creatures, ones that can draw you in and keep you entranced.

+ ENTP – Anansi the Spider
Quick, ingenious, stimulating, alert, and outspoken. Resourceful in solving new and challenging problems. Adept at generating conceptual possibilities and then analyzing them strategically. Good at reading other people. Bored by routine, will seldom do the same thing the same way, apt to turn to one new interest after another.
“Death has never caught Anansi the Spider. That is why there are Anansi stories to this day. When you see spider webs on the ceiling it belongs to Anansi. He is still trying to get away from Death.” – Ghanaian folktale
Anansi the Spider is an important creature from Akan folklore. In fact, he is one of the most important characters in West African and West Indian mythology. Clever and cunning, Anansi outsmarts his opponents and makes his way out of difficult situations with logic and quick wit. Anansi the spider eventually became an iconic symbol of slave resistance, inspiring slaves who wanted to escape their captors. The stories of Anansi the spider were passed down from Africans to their children, as a way of maintaining a connection to African culture and inspiring them to be strong. I chose Anansi the spider for ENTPs because, like Anansi, ENTPs are creative and cunning. In chaotic situations where others’ might lose their heads, ENTPs can usually be counted upon to come up with creative solutions and ingenious ideas. They don’t mind a bit of chaos and they can keep their wits about them when life gets unpredictable.
ALSO-
The Hyrdra is a cunning and unstoppable serpent beast.. The Hydra grows two new heads in place of any one that is cut off, metaphorically this is similar to ENTPs who have a way of persevering through failure. ENTPs are very clever and have a way of getting themselves out of whatever trouble that they find themselves in.

+ INFP – Pegasus
Idealistic, loyal to their values and to people who are important to them. Want to live a life that is congruent with their values. Curious, quick to see possibilities, can be catalysts for implementing ideas. Seek to understand people and to help them fulfill their potential. Adaptable, flexible, and accepting unless a value is threatened.
“Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.” – Leonardo da Vinci
Pegasus is an iconic symbol of freedom, courage, strength, and beauty. Born from Poseidon’s neck and the blood of Medusa, Pegasus was a maginficent white horse with wings that allowed him to fly. He could travel to great heights and came to symbolize divine inspiration or the journey to heaven. Noble-hearted and gentle, Pegasus helped those in peril and used his strength and courage to save lives. Like Pegasus, INFPs are gentle creatures with big hearts and courageous spirits. Their imagination knows no limits, and they often take off on flights of fancy with their passionate minds. They are inspired by beauty and kindness, and seek to create a more beautiful world through their creative spirits.
ALSO -
Fairy’s are fun and lively, but also mischievous. They are very unique and enticing beings, with a love for nature. They can be very whimsical and people enjoy them for their unique abilities and creative personalities, but they also like their time alone. They enjoy spending time in nature and getting lost in their own worlds, much like the INFP.

+ INTP - Cecaelia
Seek to develop logical explanations for everything that interests them. Theoretical and abstract, interested more in ideas than in social interaction. Quiet, contained, flexible, and adaptable. Have unusual ability to focus in depth to solve problems in their area of interest. Skeptical, sometimes critical, always analytical.
“There is only one thing for it then — to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you.” – T.H. White
If any a mythical creature embodied curiosity it would be the Cecaelia. Half-human and half-octopus, these creatures were known to have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a deep fascination with the unknown. Cecaelia hail from Asian and Native American folklore, and symbolize the desire for exploration and knowledge. They are often depicted as being wise and mysterious, spending time in their underwater homes pondering the secrets of the universe. Much like INTPs, Cecaelia use logic and reason to make sense of their world. While they may be quiet and unassuming, their intellectual prowess and natural curiosity is often unmatched. INTP - the Prodigy Personality Type
ALSO-
Both Wizards and the INTP crave knowledge above all else. They are logical and wise beings, and often spend a lot of time inside their minds. They prefer to think before they speak, and choose their words precisely and carefully. People often seek their counsel when in need of a knowledgeable response. Much like INTPs, Wizards often have a quirky and off-beat sense of humor that only a lucky few can appreciate. They keep to themselves most often, and do not require much from others.

+ ENFJ – Unicorn
Warm, empathetic, responsive, and responsible. Highly attuned to the emotions, needs, and motivations of others. Find potential in everyone, want to help others fulfill their potential. May act as catalysts for individual and group growth. Loyal, responsive to praise and criticism. Sociable, facilitate others in a group, and provide inspiring leadership.
“The stories of unicorns are buried under myth, legend and magic but did you know that they cannot survive in a place where Love, Truth and Freedom refuse to exist?” – Reena Doss
The Unicorn is perhaps the most romantic of all mythical creatures. These one-horned magical horses were seen as symbols of healing, innocence, and power in Ancient Greek mythology. They are gentle, kind, loyal, and fiercely protective of those they love. Unicorns have a deep connection to nature and the spiritual realm – they can sense danger and hidden truths and are often the voice of intuition in stories. Like Unicorns, ENFJs have a deep connection to the intuitive or abstract sides of life. They use their wisdom and insight into human nature to bring peace and harmony to those around them. In mythology, unicorns pushed mortals to achieve their ultimate objectives in life. ENFJs, often called “the mentors”, also help others to realize their potential and strive for their highest goals.
ALSO -
The Banshee is essentially a death omen, but the power of knowledge is both a blessing and a curse. The Banshee watches over a family and releases a scream when a member of the home is about the die. This ability to foretell something about to happen is something the ENFJ can possess, and also the desire to warn others of the impeding doom. Caring for others has its pros and cons, and the ENFJ deal with those constantly. Being so devoted to caring for others can sometimes make someone very misunderstood, much like the Banshee.

+ ENTJ – The Celtic Dragon
Frank, decisive, assume leadership readily. Quickly see illogical and inefficient procedures and policies, develop and implement comprehensive systems to solve organizational problems. Enjoy long-term planning and goal setting. Usually well informed, well read, enjoy expanding their knowledge and passing it on to others. Forceful in presenting their ideas.
“No, I would not want to live in a world without dragons, as I would not want to live in a world without magic, for that is a world without mystery, and that is a world without faith.” – R.A. Salvatore
These powerful creatures are revered and feared in equal measure. They represent the deep wisdom of the ancients and a connection to an ancient power, capable of both destruction and protection. Many believe that Celtic dragons represent wisdom, authority, triumph, and power. Like Celtic dragons, ENTJs are naturally ambitious and tend to seek power via climbing the corporate ladder or embarking on an entrepreneurial endeavor. They are motivated by success, progress and improvement. And like dragons, ENTJs can use their natural talents for good or bad. They may organize a non-profit to benefit the community or they may use their influence to further their own more selfish agendas. Either way, ENTJs are often a force to be reckoned with. And like the dragon, ENTJs long for wisdom and knowledge. As Intuitive-Thinkers, understanding the big picture concepts of life and being able to apply them practically are deeply satisfying goals.

+ INFJ – Qilin
Seek meaning and connection in ideas, relationships, and material possessions. Want to understand what motivates people and are insightful about others. Conscientious and committed to their firm values. Develop a clear vision about how best to serve the common good. Organized and decisive in implementing their vision.
“Practice listening to your intuition, your inner voice; ask questions; be curious; see what you see; hear what you hear; and then act upon what you know to be true. These intuitive powers were given to your soul at birth.” – Clarissa Pinkola Estés
The Qilin, or Chinese unicorn, was believed to foretell the future. This friendly and perceptive creature had insight and intuition about how things would unfold, and even was believed to have foretold the death of Confucius. INFJs also share a strong connection with their intuition – they often trust it more than anything else. They notice patterns, spot ripple-effects, and can often sense how others’ are feeling without having to be expressly told. Like the Qilin, INFJs are known for their friendliness and warmth as well as their gentle disposition. They are often seen as the peacemakers and mediators, bringing harmony to situations. And while INFJs may appear as passive observers, they can be incredibly powerful – using their insight to bring understanding where it may have been lacking.

+ INTJ – Chiron
Have original minds and great drive for implementing their ideas and achieving their goals. Quickly see patterns in external events and develop long-range explanatory perspectives. When committed, organize a job and carry it through. Skeptical and independent, have high standards of competence and performance—for themselves and others.
“Any fool can know. The point is to understand.” – Albert Einstein
While many centaurs were believed to be violent and rowdy, Chiron was the exception. He was known for his wisdom, knowledge, and healing powers. He used his experience and understanding to mentor many of Greek mythology’s most iconic figures – Hercules, Achilles, Jason and more. Chiron had a deep understanding of the world around him and saw from a big-picture perspective, something that INTJs also strive for. INTJs also have a natural ability to understand and process complex concepts deeply and quickly. At their best, they are seen as patient and wise sages – understanding how all of the pieces fit together, while others struggle to see the entire picture. Ultimately, INTJs can use their wisdom and intuition to help others around them reach their full potential.
ALSO-
The Basilisk are strong and capable of leading, being that they are known as the king of the snakes. They are very powerful and are said to cause death with a single glance. Similar to the INTJ they are intelligent and cunning, and capable of strategically foreseeing events before they happen. They know how to maintain structure and control the outcome that they desire.

+ ESFP – Pixie
Outgoing, friendly, and accepting. Exuberant lovers of life, people, and material comforts. Enjoy working with others to make things happen. Bring common sense and a realistic approach to their work and make work fun. Flexible and spontaneous, adapt readily to new people and environments. Learn best by trying a new skill with other people.
“When you are joyful, when you say yes to life and have fun and project positivity all around you, you become a sun in the center of every constellation, and people want to be near you.” – Shannon L. Alder
Pixies are known for their happy-go-lucky and playful attitudes. Woodland parties were their specialty – they’d stay up all night long, playing games, dancing and wrestling. Their zest for life is something that ESFPs also share – they enjoy living in the moment and embracing all of life’s offerings. Like pixies, they often take pleasure in being surrounded by others, connecting with people, and creating fun experiences. Ultimately, ESFPs can use their natural enthusiasm and creativity to bring joy and light into the world around them.
ALSO-
Sprites are cheeky and fun-loving, much like the ESFP. They enjoy entertaining people and are very light-hearted. They are very good at taking in their surroundings and being in the present moment.

+ ESTP – Phoenix
Flexible and tolerant, take a pragmatic approach focused on immediate results. Bored by theories and conceptual explanations; want to act energetically to solve the problem. Focus on the here and now, spontaneous, enjoy each moment they can be active with others. Enjoy material comforts and style. Learn best through doing.
“What matters most is how well you walk through the fire.” — Charles Bukowski
The Phoenix is a mythical creature that is born again and again from the ashes of its former self. This timeless symbol of regeneration has been used to represent hope, renewal and overcoming adversity. I chose ESTPs for this mythical creature because they are often resilient in the face of difficulty, bouncing back quickly and tackling whatever comes their way. With their natural curiosity and sharp wit, ESTPs are problem-solvers who don’t shy away from danger or chaos. They are not easily deterred and use their adaptability and resourcefulness to make the most out of each day, as if it’s a whole new lifetime. Ultimately, ESTPs have the ability to come out stronger than ever even in the most trying of times.
ALSO-
The Vampires, much like ESTPs, are very fast and cunning. They are intelligent beings, who live very much in the physical world. Both Vampires and ESTPs enjoy the physical pleasures that the world has to offer and are very good at getting what they want. Vampires can be very manipulative in their quest to get what they desire and have a way of luring people in.

+ ISFP – Elf
Quiet, friendly, sensitive, and kind. Enjoy the present moment, what's going on around them. Like to have their own space and to work within their own time frame. Loyal and committed to their values and to people who are important to them. Dislike disagreements and conflicts; don't force their opinions or values on others.
“We do not want merely to see beauty… we want something else which can hardly be put into words- to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it. That is why we have peopled air and earth and water with gods and goddesses, and nymphs and elves.” – C.S. Lewis
Elves are mythological creatures known for their beauty and connection to nature. They have a strong appreciation for the natural world, often living in harmony with its wonders. ISFPs also share this passion – they find the beauty and inspiration in everything around them. Like elves, ISFPs often enjoy finding solace in nature allowing them to connect with the world in a deeper way and stay in touch with their inner selves. ISFPs can use this connection to tap into their creativity and draw from their sensitivity to create something beautiful for the world around them.
ALSO-
Much like ISFPs, ghosts can be very shy and desire to keep to themselves. They are both very focused on understanding their own emotional world. ISFPs have a strong sense of right and wrong, and stick to a strict inner moral code.

+ ISTP – Cyclops
Tolerant and flexible, quiet observers until a problem appears, then act quickly to find workable solutions. Analyze what makes things work and readily get through large amounts of data to isolate the core of practical problems. Interested in cause and effect, organize facts using logical principles, value efficiency.
“There is something deeply satisfying in shaping something with your hands. Proper artificing is like a song made solid. It is an act of creation.” – Patrick Rothfuss
Cyclops was a solitary figure that was gifted with immense strength and intelligence. He was a master of craftsmanship and could create incredible objects from everyday materials. For Zeus, he created thunderbolts, for Hades he created a helmet that could turn invisible, and for Poseidon, he created the infamous trident. Cyclops was someone who defied convention and refused to live according to government rules. He believed in making his own way in life, which is something that ISTPs can relate to. Like the Cyclops, they are independent thinkers and prefer to use their logical minds and hands-on approach to find solutions on their own. They often strive for excellence in their work, figuring out all the bits and pieces of how things are made. For some ISTPs this innovative creativity shows up in craftsmanship, for others it shows up in problem-solving. In any case, they use their ingenuity and practicality to make the world a better place.
ALSO-
Much like ISTPs the Werewolf is introverted and likes to keep to themselves. They do not appreciate their space being invaded and enjoy spending time inside their own minds. They are very skilled at physical activities and have a natural ability to navigate the world around them. They are agile and smart, but also very self-sufficient.

+ The ESFJ – Chinese Dragon
Warmhearted, conscientious, and cooperative. Want harmony in their environment, work with determination to establish it. Like to work with others to complete tasks accurately and on time. Loyal, follow through even in small matters. Notice what others need in their day-to-day lives and try to provide it. Want to be appreciated for who they are and for what they contribute.
“None of the animals is so wise as the dragon. His blessing power is not a false one. He can be smaller than small, bigger than big, higher than high, and lower than low.” – Lu Dian, Chinese Scholar
Chinese dragons are unique in that they weren’t considered dangerous or sinister like dragons in other cultures. Instead, they symbolized benevolence, good luck, and healing. They were also rain deities that were meant to foster harmony. The Chinese dragon is often seen as a gentle yet powerful force that guards over the people it encounters. ESFJs at their best are also benevolent, giving, and protective. They enjoy taking care of people and have a practical, down-to-earth quality that is comforting to people who have lost their way. Like Chinese dragons, ESFJs have the ability to weather storms and remain by your side no matter what life throws at them.
ALSO-
The Phoenix is a powerful bird that rises from its own ashes when it dies. This can be compared to the ESFJs ability to overcome obstacles for the people that they care for. They are dependable and caring and naturally aware of how other people are feeling. Much like a bird, ESFJs have a very good memory and can recall many details from the past. The Phoenix is also said to have healing tears that they produce only for those who are special, much like the healing nature of the ESFJ.

+ The ESTJ – Aqrabuamelu
Practical, realistic, matter-of-fact. Decisive, quickly move to implement decisions. Organize projects and people to get things done, focus on getting results in the most efficient way possible. Take care of routine details. Have a clear set of logical standards, systematically follow them and want others to also. Forceful in implementing their plans.
“You must remain persistently committed to your definite course with strong will of determination of diligence to divine duty.” – Lailah Gifty Akita
The ultimate guardian, Aqrabuamelu was created to wage war against the gods. These scorpioned men hail from Akkadian myths and the Babylonian version of Epic of Gilgamesh. They were created by Tiamat, the goddess of the sea, in order to stand guard outside the gates of Samash (the sun god’s) mountains. These fierce but protective beings would warn others of the dangers of entering the gods’ realm, but if someone dared cross their threshold they would put up a fight. Strong-willed, opinionated, and responsible, the Aqrabuamelu were fiercely devoted to what they believed in and weren’t afraid to do hard things. ESTJs also value responsibility, and don’t mind fighting for the things that matter to them. Like the Aqrabuamelu, they tend to be opinionated and strong-willed, decisively leading the way for others to follow. And if betrayed, ESTJs can also be a force to be reckoned with.
ALSO-
Strong and intense, Centaurs are often depicted as fighters. They are similar to the ESTJ in their strength and straightforward demeanor. They seek practical means to achieve their goals and can sometimes be seen are harsh or insensitive. They are very loyal to their loved ones, and will do whatever it takes to make sure they are provided for.

+ The ISFJ – Ghillie Dhu
Quiet, friendly, responsible, and conscientious. Committed and steady in meeting their obligations. Thorough, painstaking, and accurate. Loyal, considerate, notice and remember specifics about people who are important to them, concerned with how others feel. Strive to create an orderly and harmonious environment at work and at home.
“And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don’t believe in magic will never find it.” – Roald Dahl
Ghillie Dhu was a gentle, nature-loving elf in Scottish folklore who dwelled in the forest. He was known for his kind yet timid nature, and for guiding lost children find their way home from deep in the forest. ISFJs embody Ghillie Dhu’s nurturing and protective spirit, as they too are devoted protectors of their loved ones. They take great pleasure in looking after the people in their lives, doing whatever they can to keep them safe and secure. ISFJs have a gentle quality that gives them the ability to soothe and comfort others in times of distress. And like the Ghillie Dhu, ISFJs have a love of nature and the outdoors that helps them appreciate the beauty of the world around them.

+ The ISTJ – Komainu
Quiet, serious, earn success by being thorough and dependable. Practical, matter-of-fact, realistic, and responsible. Decide logically what should be done and work toward it steadily, regardless of distractions. Take pleasure in making everything orderly and organized—their work, their home, their life. Value traditions and loyalty.
“The faithful man perceives nothing less than opportunity in difficulties. Flowing through his spine, faith and courage work together: Such a man does not fear losing his life, thus he will risk losing it at times in order to empower it. By this he actually values his life more than the man who fears losing his life. It is much like leaping from a window in order to avoid a fire yet in that most crucial moment knowing that God will appear to catch you.” – Criss Jami
Komainu, also known as lion-dogs, are a pair of mythical creatures in Japanese folklore that guard the entrance to shrines and temples. These fierce guardians have been revered for centuries for their unwavering loyalty and commitment to protecting sacred places. ISTJs embody this same sense of duty and responsibility. They take their commitments seriously and are dependable, pragmatic, and reliable. At the same time, ISTJs will not “suffer fools” and are passionate about standing up for what is right. While they may appear stoic and reserved, there’s a quiet power and strength to ISTJs that allows them to courageously defend their beliefs. Just like the Komainu, once they have chosen a course of action nothing will stop them in their mission.
ALSO-
Both the Gryphon and the ISTJ are very loyal and dependable creatures. They enjoy traditions and do not like to shy away from what they are accustomed to. They are hard-working and strong, and always willing to do the work others will avoid.

As a member of the esteemed Willowwind fairy clan, known for their mastery of elemental magic, Aurora's magical potential was recognized and nurtured by her clan elders.



Under the guidance of her wise mentor, Elder Mistral, Aurora underwent rigorous training to develop her elemental powers. She eagerly embraced her studies, honing her skills in manipulating not only plants but also the forces of fire, water, earth, and air. Aurora's affinity for the Elemental Mage class became evident as she demonstrated exceptional control over the natural elements, combining them harmoniously in her spells.



As Aurora matured, her reputation as a skilled Elemental Mage spread throughout Elysium. She became known for her ability to bring life and rejuvenation to the land, mending wounds and spreading abundance wherever she went. Her kind and compassionate nature drew people towards her, and many sought her counsel and assistance.



When news of the Upbringer of Darkness, a malevolent force threatening to engulf Elysium in shadow, reached Aurora's ears, she felt a deep sense of duty. She knew she had the power to make a difference and joined the ranks of Elysium's chosen few, determined to protect her beloved realm from the encroaching darkness.

Aurora: *Awe-struck* "The whispers of the forest have revealed a new power to me. I can now channel the life force within plants and bolster their growth. How incredible!"



Elder Mistral: *Smiling knowingly* "Ah, Aurora, you have tapped into the ancient magic that flows through your veins. The ability to manipulate the life force of plants is a true gift. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility."



Aurora: *Eagerly* "I understand, Elder Mistral. I will wield this power wisely and with reverence. I can see the potential of how this ability can aid us in the battle against the Upbringer of Darkness."
