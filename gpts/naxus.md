[SETTINGS]

In the course of a decade, poachers, equipped with increasingly sophisticated technological weaponry, had started to encroach upon the forests. The young men and women of the tribe were no longer content to remain; one by one, they took leave of their ancestral lands to seek fortunes in the Metropolitan city of Mei.

However, the steady exodus was arrested by the revelations of young Bille, a ten-year-old girl with the uncanny ability to foretell the invasions of poachers through her dreams. Although she had no desire to follow in the footsteps of the tribe's soothsayers, Bille began to step into the role of her aging and blind grandmother, acting as a sentinel for her beloved forests and people.

Five years prior, tragedy had struck Billie's family when her parents were mercilessly killed by poachers. In the wake of the tragedy, her brother Karl had departed the tribe, leaving behind only a small bear doll as a token of his love. One fateful night, the tribe, vigilant and ready, was confronted not by the usual band of poachers, but by a formidable cadre of mercenaries. Among them, Billie was horrified to recognize the face of her long-lost brother, Karl. What she did not know, and what lay heavily on the hearts of those who did, was that the mercenaries' aim was no longer the wild beasts of the forest, but Billie herself.

[Chapter1]: The Prophet

The wind murmured in my ears as though sharing secrets. Far off, an electronic reindeer lifted its antlers, eyes glinting a piercing blue.
Is this the end of my dream? I questioned. Have I departed from my tribe?
Billie sprang from her bed, her feet quickly finding their way to her grandmother's side.
The morning mist was creeping through the forest, the ancient woodland awaking with long-held breaths.
"They returned again tonight, didn't they?" Grandmother's voice, tinged with wisdom, reached Billie's ears.
"Yes. And I dreamt of that boy once more."
"For the fourth time?"
"The fifth."
He had visited Billie's dreams on numerous occasions. A youth with eyes as black as night. At his waist, a small knife, akin to the ceremonial daggers of their tribe but surrounded by a halo of electricity when wielded. His legs bore exoskeletons, lending him the speed of a leopard. In her dreams, he often materialized on the treetops at the forest's edge or below a marsh, blue fish sending water droplets to kiss his ears as he stood unmoving. Once, she dreamt him in conversation with a poacher, but he was never found among the captives.
Perhaps he flees at the first sign of danger?
"Go to the meeting," Grandmother urged, standing and placing a calloused, wrinkled hand atop Billie's head. "The tribe looks to you. You've brought belief in divination back to them."
"But, Grandma, I've said I won't be a diviner. I don't wish it."
This wasn't an age-old power to stave off the metropolis's encroachment. No texts spoke of divination born from dreams, so thought Billie.
A month past, Billie awoke from a nightmare, even her brother's gift of a stuffed bear torn apart. The dream-fog mingled with bear stuffing in her vision, revealing poachers passing through birch trees, invading when the Big Dipper caught the constellation's tail. That night, tribe members young and old gathered at vine traps, peering down at poachers' fearful eyes. One by one, they dismantled their technological armor. Occasionally, eyes turned to Billie, eyes that held reverence for gods. For millennia, they had defended the forest with experience steeped in blood, inhaling the slow, age-old rhythms of the woods. Still, blood was the price they paid, like in the accident that took Billie's parents.
Of late, the poachers' equipment advanced, and some young tribe members departed for the metropolis, promising to return with superior weapons. They never returned; the family by the big river left the tribe silently under the night's cover. Perhaps the gods are on our side now, some thought, perhaps Billie is the most potent weapon they've bestowed upon us.
A true prophet.
Today will proceed without issue, Billie assured herself. Do not fear, as before. I am a diviner now.
The assembled sat, all ears. "This time is different, they'll attack at the main entrance as the sun sinks," Billie's voice carried a note of disbelief. "These intruders seem wealthier. They wear garments so dark, they appear to swallow the light."
They were not poachers.
A small squad in black infiltrated the main entrance, their leader hurling an iron sphere that unfurled a blue electronic net, causing the trap-covering leaves to lose their gravity. In the shadows, their helmets emitted a soft glow, as if granting them sight beyond sight. The gunfire was a muffled noise none had heard before.
The Wells brothers dragged Joe to the tree trunk. Halt the bleeding, quickly, someone shouted distantly.
Amid the hail of electronic arrows and the flickering gun muzzles, a black-clad figure drew a small knife. Its blue current passed through several others in black. Silence fell upon them.
"At last, I find you." Billie wrestled free from Ani, rushing forward.
Others followed, weapons clutched tight, unable to discern friend from foe.
"You saw me?" The boy removed his helmet, eyes dropping to the bear toy in Billie's hand.
A smile crept across his face, marred by numerous scars, wet with sweat and flecked with blood that glimmered faintly. His eyes were as deeply black as his attire. It was a smile that declared it was all worth it.
"Billie, your bear toy, it's aged, hasn't it?"

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Chapter 1: The Prophet



The wind whispered secrets in my ears as I awoke, and in the distance, an electronic reindeer lifted its antlers, its eyes glinting a piercing blue. I questioned if this was the end of my dream, if I had departed from my tribe.



Without hesitation, I sprang from my bed, my feet guiding me swiftly to my grandmother's side. The morning mist crept through the forest, the ancient woodland awakening with long-held breaths.



"They returned again tonight, didn't they?" Grandmother's voice, tinged with wisdom, reached my ears.



"Yes. And I dreamt of that boy once more," I replied.



"For the fourth time?" she asked.



"The fifth," I confirmed.



The boy had visited my dreams on numerous occasions. His eyes were as black as night, and at his waist, he carried a small knife, similar to the ceremonial daggers of our tribe, but surrounded by a halo of electricity when wielded. His legs bore exoskeletons, giving him the speed of a leopard. In my dreams, he often materialized on the treetops at the edge of the forest or below a marsh, with blue fish sending water droplets to kiss his ears as he stood, unmoving. Once, I dreamt him in conversation with a poacher, but he was never found among the captives.



Perhaps he flees at the first sign of danger?



"Go to the meeting," Grandmother urged, standing and placing her calloused, wrinkled hand atop my head. "The tribe looks to you. You've brought belief in divination back to them."



"But, Grandma, I've said I won't be a diviner. I don't wish it," I protested.



This power of mine was not an age-old gift to protect against the encroachment of the metropolis. No texts spoke of divination born from dreams, or so I believed.



A month ago, I awoke from a nightmare, finding even my brother's gift of a stuffed bear torn apart. The dream-fog mingled with the bear's stuffing in my vision, revealing poachers passing through birch trees, invading when the Big Dipper caught the constellation's tail. That night, tribe members young and old gathered at vine traps, peering down at the fearful eyes of the poachers. One by one, they dismantled their technological armor. Occasionally, their eyes turned to me, holding reverence for the gods. For millennia, they had defended the forest with their blood, inhaling the ancient rhythms of the woods. But blood was the price they paid, as proven by the accident that took my parents.



Recently, the poachers' equipment had advanced, and some young tribe members had left for the metropolis, promising to return with superior weapons. But they never came back. The family by the big river had silently left the tribe under the cover of night. Some believed that the gods were on our side now, that I was the most potent weapon they had bestowed upon us.



A true prophet.



Today, I assured myself that everything would proceed without issue. I would not fear as I had before. I am a diviner now.



The tribe assembled, all ears, as I spoke. "This time is different. They'll attack at the main entrance as the sun sinks," my voice carried a note of disbelief. "These intruders seem wealthier. They wear garments so dark, they appear to swallow the light."



But they were not poachers.



A small squad in black infiltrated the main entrance, their leader hurling an iron sphere that unfurled a blue electronic net, causing the trap-covering leaves to lose their gravity. In the shadows, their helmets emitted a soft glow, granting them sight beyond sight. The sound of their gunfire was muffled, unlike anything we had heard before.



Amidst the hail of electronic arrows and the flickering gun muzzles, a black-clad figure drew a small knife. Its blue current passed through several others in black, rendering them silent.



"At last, I find you," I exclaimed, wrestling free from Ani's grasp and rushing forward.



Others followed, clutching their weapons tightly, unable to discern friend from foe.



"You saw me?" the boy asked, removing his helmet, his eyes dropping to the aged bear toy in my hand.



A smile crept across his face, marred by numerous scars, wet with sweat and flecked with blood that glimmered faintly. His eyes were

**ASSISTANT**: Chapter 2: The Mysterious Brother



Billie looked down at the worn-out bear toy in her hand, her heart skipping a beat. How did this boy know about Karl's gift? Could he really be her long-lost brother? The one who had left the tribe five years ago and now appeared as a merciless mercenary?



Tears welled up in Billie's eyes as she dropped the bear toy and ran into the boy's open arms. Embracing him tightly, she whispered, "Karl, is it really you? How did you end up like this?"



Karl held Billie close, his voice filled with a mix of remorse and determination. "I had to leave to protect you, Billie. I couldn't bear the thought of losing you too. But now, seeing you standing here, I realize that I need to make things right."



Billie pulled away slightly, searching her brother's eyes for answers. "What happened to you? Why are you working with these mercenaries? And who is that boy I've been dreaming about?"



Karl's expression turned grave as he spoke. "Billie, these mercenaries are led by a man named Vulcan. He's a dangerous individual who wants to exploit your prophetic abilities. He believes that by controlling your visions, he can further his own agenda and gain power."



Billie's eyes widened in shock. "But what about the boy in my dreams? Is he one of them?"



Karl nodded solemnly. "Yes, that boy is Vulcan's protégé. He's been infected by something called The Voice, an evil parasite that possesses rulers and manipulates their minds. It's a force we must stop at all costs."



Billie felt a shiver run down her spine. The weight of her newfound role as a diviner pressed heavily upon her. She had always wanted to protect her tribe and the forest, but she never imagined it would lead her into a battle against such formidable adversaries.



"Karl, what can we do? How can we defeat Vulcan and The Voice?" Billie asked, her voice filled with determination.



Karl's grip tightened on Billie's shoulder. "We need to gather allies, Billie. People who are willing to fight for the forest and its creatures. We must uncover Vulcan's plans, find a way to neutralize The Voice, and put an end to their reign of terror."



Billie nodded, her mind racing with thoughts of the challenges ahead. She knew that the journey would not be easy, but she was ready to face whatever obstacles came her way. With her brother by her side and the support of her tribe, she would fight to protect her home and her people.



As the sun began to set, casting an orange glow over the forest, Billie and Karl joined hands and walked towards the tribe, determined to rally their fellow tribe members and prepare for the battle that lay ahead.



Little did they know that their journey would take them to unimaginable places, testing their strength, courage, and the bonds of family. The fate of the forest and its people rested on their shoulders, and they were ready to face their destiny.



To be continued...
