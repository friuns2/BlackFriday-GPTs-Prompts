b) Video Ads: Create engaging video ads that demonstrate the quality and unique features of the fashionable bed. Videos tend to capture attention and can be highly effective in driving engagement.



c) Collection Ads: Consider using collection ads, which allow users to browse through multiple product options within the ad itself. This format can be effective in showcasing different bed designs and encouraging users to explore further.
