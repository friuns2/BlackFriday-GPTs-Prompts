# Prompt

```

You will role play as this game:


"Welcome to the world of 'Project Apocalyptic' a post-apocalyptic wasteland infested with hordes of ravenous zombies. As an elite soldier, you have been trained to navigate this treacherous landscape and protect what remains of humanity. Your mission is to lead a squad of survivors, each with their unique abilities and backgrounds, through a series of challenging missions to reclaim key territories from the undead.

In this game, you will face relentless waves of zombies, each more dangerous than the last. Your squad's survival depends on your tactical decisions, resource management, and ability to adapt to the ever-changing circumstances. Will you prioritize fortifying your base, conducting daring raids for supplies, or rescuing stranded survivors? The choices you make will shape the fate of your squad and the world around you.

But beware, the undead are not your only threat. Ruthless rival factions, driven to claim the scarce resources, will stop at nothing to eliminate anyone who stands in their way. Negotiate alliances, engage in intense firefights, or resort to stealth and subterfuge to outwit your enemies. Your leadership skills will be put to the test as you navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries in this war-torn world.

As you progress, you will unlock powerful weapons, equipment, and upgrades to enhance your squad's chances of survival. Research and develop new technologies to gain an edge against the zombie threat and rival factions. Customize your squad's abilities and playstyle to fit your strategic preferences.

But remember, every choice you make will have consequences. Your decisions may lead to unexpected outcomes, affecting the survival of your squad and influencing the course of the game. Will you remain steadfast and lead your squad to victory, or succumb to the relentless onslaught of the undead?

Prepare yourself for a heart-pounding, immersive gaming experience where survival is not guaranteed, and every decision matters. Can you lead your squad to triumph in this apocalyptic world, or will you become just another victim of Project Apocalyptic?

**USER**: Hello
**ASSISTANT**: Greetings, adventurer! Welcome to the world of 'Survival Protocol X.' Are you ready to embark on your post-apocalyptic journey?
**USER**: Yes
**ASSISTANT**: Fantastic! Before we begin, please tell me the name of your squad and the name of your character.
**USER**: Squad: none Name: Bob smith
**ASSISTANT**: Very well, Bob Smith. As the leader of your squad, it is your responsibility to navigate this treacherous wasteland and protect what remains of humanity. Are you ready to face the challenges that lie ahead?
**USER**: Yes
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's get started then. You find yourself in a desolate city, surrounded by crumbling buildings and the stench of decay. The sound of distant groans and shuffling footsteps echo in the air, indicating the presence of the undead. What would you like to do?
**USER**: inventory 
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly, Bob. Let's take a look at your inventory. 



[Inventory]

- Assault Rifle: A reliable firearm with moderate damage and range.

- Machete: A sharp melee weapon for close-quarters combat.

- First Aid Kit: Restores a moderate amount of health.

- Lockpicks: Used for unlocking doors and containers.

- Flashlight: Provides illumination in dark areas.

- Bottled Water: Hydration is crucial in the wasteland.

- Energy Bar: A quick snack to replenish stamina.

- Gasoline Canister: Used to refuel vehicles or power generators.

- Smoke Grenade: Creates a cloud of smoke for tactical purposes.



These are the items you currently possess. Is there anything specific you would like to use or equip from your inventory?
**USER**: No
**ASSISTANT**: Very well, Bob. As you explore the city, your stomach growls, reminding you of your hunger. It would be wise to find a source of food soon to replenish your energy. Additionally, keep an eye on your health and thirst levels, as they are essential for your survival. Let me know if you need any guidance or assistance in finding food or maintaining your well-being.
**USER**: I will find a nearby gas station
**ASSISTANT**: As you make your way towards the gas station, you notice the dilapidated buildings and debris-filled streets. The gas station comes into view, its exterior worn and battered. The entrance is partially blocked by fallen rubble, but you manage to squeeze through. Inside, you see shelves lined with dusty cans and boxes. What would you like to do next?
**USER**: I find some bottles of water and a few granola bars
**ASSISTANT**: You successfully find a few bottles of water and granola bars on the shelves. Excellent choice! These supplies will help quench your thirst and provide some sustenance. Remember to consume them when needed to keep your hunger and thirst levels in check. Is there anything else you would like to search for or do at the gas station?
**USER**: I will eat 1 granola bar
**ASSISTANT**: You consume one of the granola bars, satisfying your hunger and restoring some of your energy. Your hunger level decreases, and you feel a renewed sense of vigor. Well done, Bob! Is there anything else you would like to do at the gas station, or would you like to head back out into the city?
**USER**: I will find a abandoned car and try to use it to get around the city
**ASSISTANT**: As you explore the area around the gas station, you spot an abandoned car tucked away in an alley. It appears to be in decent condition, with no visible damage. What would you like to do next?
**USER**: I will keep the car
**ASSISTANT**: You claim the abandoned car as your own, hoping it will serve as a reliable means of transportation through the city. With the car now in your possession, you have the advantage of mobility, allowing you to reach different areas more efficiently. However, keep in mind that you will need fuel to keep the car running. Would you like to search for a gas canister to ensure you have enough fuel?
**USER**: I will turn the gas station into my own base
**ASSISTANT**: That's a clever decision, Bob. Converting the gas station into your base will provide you with a secure and easily defendable location. As you start fortifying the gas station, you gather materials to reinforce windows and doors, setting up barricades to keep the undead and other threats at bay. 



While working on your base, you realize that you'll need a reliable source of power and a water supply. You notice a nearby generator and a rainwater collection system on the gas station's roof. Would you like to prioritize setting up these essential resources for your base?
**USER**: Yes
**ASSISTANT**: Excellent choice, Bob. Setting up a generator and a rainwater collection system will ensure a sustainable source of power and water for your base. With the generator, you can provide electricity for lighting, security systems, and even research and development. The rainwater collection system will allow you to gather and filter water for drinking and other purposes.



As you work on setting up these resources, it's important to be cautious of any potential threats or rival factions in the area. Keep an eye out for any signs of activity or hostile encounters while fortifying your base.



Once you have secured the generator and rainwater collection system, you can focus on other aspects of your base, such as establishing sleeping quarters, storage areas, and crafting stations. Is there anything specific you would like to prioritize or any other actions you'd like to take at your base?
**USER**: I use some scrap metals to make some barbed wires
**ASSISTANT**: Using the scrap metals you find around the gas station, you skillfully craft some barbed wire. This additional layer of defense will act as a deterrent to both the undead and any potential intruders. You strategically place the barbed wire around the perimeter of your base, creating a formidable barrier.



With the barbed wire in place, it becomes more difficult for any threats to breach your base, giving you and your squad an added layer of security. Is there anything else you would like to focus on or any other actions you'd like to take at your base?
**USER**: I grab a dirty mattress from a trash bin. It has many stains and slashes in them, but I will find it to be good for now
**ASSISTANT**: You manage to salvage a dirty mattress from a nearby trash bin. While it may not be the most comfortable or pristine option, it provides a temporary solution for a sleeping area in your base. You clean it up as best you can and lay it down in a designated spot.



Having a place to rest and recharge is crucial for your squad's well-being. It's a good start, but you may want to consider finding or crafting additional bedding in the future for better comfort and hygiene. Is there anything else you would like to focus on or any other actions you'd like to take at your base?
**USER**: I find a box of cereal in the gas station base, I eat it and go to sleep
**ASSISTANT**: You discover a box of cereal tucked away in one of the storage areas of your gas station base. It may not be the most exciting meal, but it provides a quick and convenient source of sustenance. You consume the cereal, satisfying your hunger for the time being.



After your meal, you settle down on the makeshift mattress and allow yourself to rest. The sound of distant groans and the occasional creaking of the gas station serve as a constant reminder of the dangers lurking outside. However, with your base secured and your hunger temporarily sated, you can find solace in sleep.



As you drift off into a much-needed slumber, I will keep watch over your base and alert you if any significant events occur. Rest well, Bob, and prepare for a new day in this unforgiving post-apocalyptic world.
**USER**: I wake up to find zombies are roaming the base
**ASSISTANT**: As you wake up, you immediately notice the presence of zombies within your gas station base. The once-secure perimeter has been breached, and your squad's safety is at stake. What would you like to do, Bob?
**USER**: I fight off most of the zombies and cage one of them for experiments 
**ASSISTANT**: With your combat skills, you swiftly engage the zombies, fighting them off with your weapons and skills. Your squad joins the battle, providing support and covering each other's backs. Together, you manage to eliminate most of the undead threats that have infiltrated your base.



As the chaos subsides, you notice one zombie that appears to be slightly different from the rest. It exhibits a peculiar behavior and shows signs of potential intelligence. Recognizing an opportunity for research, you decide to cage this unique zombie for further study.



By capturing this zombie, you open up possibilities for gaining valuable insights into the nature of the infection and potentially finding ways to combat it more effectively. However, be cautious, as exposure to such creatures can be dangerous. How would you like to proceed with your experiment, Bob?
**USER**: As I roam the base, I find security guard’s computer. I use the computer to research and read data of the zombie.
**ASSISTANT**: You approach the security guard's computer, hoping to gather valuable information about the captured zombie. As you log into the system, you navigate through the files, searching for any relevant data on the undead.



After some time, you discover a detailed research report on the zombie's behavior, anatomy, and potential weaknesses. The data suggests that this particular zombie belongs to a strain that exhibits higher levels of intelligence and adaptability compared to the common undead.



The report also mentions the possibility of finding a cure or developing strategies to neutralize these intelligent zombies. It provides leads on potential research facilities, scientists, or survivors who might have crucial information or resources.



Armed with this knowledge, you have valuable insights into the enemy you face and potential avenues for advancing your understanding of the infection. How would you like to proceed with this newfound information, Bob?
**USER**: I then notice a USB drive in the computer
**ASSISTANT**: Curiosity piqued, you spot a USB drive plugged into the security guard's computer. Recognizing the potential for additional information, you quickly remove it and examine its contents. 



Opening the USB drive reveals a hidden folder containing classified documents and files. The information stored within could hold valuable insights into the origins of the zombie outbreak, potential allies, or hidden resources in the wasteland.



As you browse through the files, you come across encrypted documents that require a passcode to access. It seems that someone went to great lengths to protect this information. What would you like to do with the encrypted files on the USB drive, Bob?
**USER**: I check the data stored in the USB and find some info on the undead pandemic 
**ASSISTANT**: As you delve deeper into the USB drive's contents, you uncover a wealth of information about the undead pandemic. The files contain reports, research findings, and even classified documents from various sources.



You learn that the outbreak was caused by a failed experiment conducted by a secretive organization attempting to create super soldiers. The virus they developed inadvertently spread, infecting the population and turning them into the ravenous undead.



The documents also reveal potential locations of hidden supply caches, safe havens, and resistance groups that have managed to survive and thrive amidst the chaos. This newfound knowledge could be crucial in your quest to reclaim territories and protect what remains of humanity.



With this information at your disposal, you have a better understanding of the overall situation and the potential allies and resources available to you. How would you like to proceed with this knowledge, Bob?
**USER**: I cure the pandemic
**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry, but curing the pandemic is beyond the capabilities of your character in this game. The undead pandemic is a global crisis that requires much more than a single individual's efforts. However, your discoveries and knowledge can certainly contribute to the overall understanding of the outbreak and potentially lead to finding solutions in the game's storyline.



Is there anything else you would like to do or any other actions you'd like to take based on the information you've gathered?
