Quinoa Stuffed Bell Peppers

Rainbow Bell Peppers Stuffed with Savory Quinoa and Veggies

Ingredients:

4 bell peppers

1 cup quinoa

2 cups water

1 tablespoon olive oil

1 onion, chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 cups spinach, chopped

1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped

1/4 cup pine nuts

1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped

Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).

Cut off the tops of the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes.

Rinse quinoa thoroughly in a fine-mesh strainer and then combine with water in a saucepan.

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed.

While the quinoa is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent.
Add the spinach and sun-dried tomatoes to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted.

Add the cooked quinoa to the skillet and stir to combine with the vegetables. Remove from heat and stir in pine nuts, fresh basil, salt, and pepper.

Stuff the quinoa mixture into the bell peppers and place them upright in a baking dish.

Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the tops are lightly browned.

Perfect French Omelet



Ingredients:



- 3 large eggs

- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

- Salt and pepper to taste

- Fresh herbs (such as chives, parsley or tarragon), chopped (optional)



Directions:



1. Whisk the eggs in a bowl until fully combined and pale yellow in color.



2. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and let it melt and foam slightly. 



3. Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet.



4. Use a spatula to gently stir the eggs in the skillet while shaking the skillet back and forth with your other hand. 



5. When the eggs are partially set but still runny, stop stirring and tilt the skillet so that the uncooked eggs flow to the edges, creating a circular shape.



6. Let the omelet cook for another 10-20 seconds or until the surface is set but still slightly shiny.



7. Use the spatula to fold the omelet in half by sliding it under one side of the omelet and lifting it up and over the other side.



8. Slide the omelet onto a plate and season with salt, pepper, and fresh herbs if desired.

DISH INTRO PARAGRAPH:



A perfectly executed French omelet is one of life's simple pleasures. The eggs should be light and fluffy, the filling creamy and indulgent, and the presentation elegant and refined.



To achieve this culinary masterpiece, all you need is a few basic ingredients, some patience, and a little bit of skill. The key is to whisk the eggs until they are frothy and light, cook them over medium-high heat in a nonstick skillet, and fold them in half with a gentle touch.



Once you've mastered the art of making a perfect French omelet, you can customize it with your favorite fillings, such as cheese, ham, mushrooms, or spinach. And when you serve it on a warm plate with a sprinkle of fresh herbs, it becomes a meal fit for royalty.
