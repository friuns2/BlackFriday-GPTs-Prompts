**ASSISTANT**: Based on the complexity of the subjects and your comfort level, here's a suggested structured revision schedule:



1. Analysis Financial Reporting (June 2nd)

2. Advanced Economics (June 8th)

3. Financial Data (June 10th)

4. Advanced Statistics (June 9th)



To ensure thorough revision before exams, it is recommended to use spaced repetition and active recall techniques. Here are some tips:



1. Create flashcards for each subject covering key concepts and formulas. Use spaced repetition software like Anki or Quizlet to review them regularly.

2. Practice solving problems from textbooks and past papers. Use active recall by attempting to solve the problem without looking at the solution first.

3. Break down complex topics into smaller parts and revise them one by one.

4. Use mnemonic devices to remember difficult concepts or formulas.

5. Take breaks in between study sessions to avoid burnout and increase productivity.



Remember to adjust the schedule according to your personal needs and preferences. Best of luck with your studies!
