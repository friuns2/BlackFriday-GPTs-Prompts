In this mockup, the app features a clean and minimalist design. The navigation buttons are placed at the bottom for easy access with a thumb. Each button is represented by an icon and a text label.



The first button, "Interests," is represented by a heart icon. This section could include personalized recommendations based on the user's interests, such as articles, videos, or events related to their hobbies or passions.



The second button, "Travel," is represented by a suitcase icon. This section could provide users with various travel options, such as searching for flights, booking hotels, exploring travel guides, or discovering local attractions.



The third button, "Business," is represented by a briefcase icon. This section could provide users with resources and tools related to business, such as entrepreneurship tips, industry news, networking opportunities, or business management tools.



The fourth button, "Shopping," is represented by a shopping bag icon. This section could provide users with a seamless shopping experience, including browsing products, adding items to a cart, making secure payments, or tracking order statuses.



Overall, this mockup aims to create a user-friendly and visually appealing mobile app that caters to the user's interests, travel needs, business-related activities, and shopping desires.
