Value Proposition: Our subscription-based platform connects freelance professionals with businesses in need of their services in a seamless and efficient manner, saving time and money for both parties.



Target Market: Small and medium-sized businesses across various industries that require specialized services such as graphic design, writing, programming, accounting, and more.



Pricing Strategy: We will implement a tiered pricing strategy based on the number of freelancers a business wants to hire and the level of service they require. The pricing will be competitive and offer good value for money.



Key Features: The platform will have an easy-to-use interface for both freelancers and businesses to create profiles, search for jobs or candidates, and communicate directly through messaging. The platform will also include payment processing and escrow services to ensure secure and timely payment transactions.



Customer Acquisition Strategies: We will use targeted online advertising, content marketing, and social media campaigns to reach potential customers. We will also establish partnerships with industry associations and business networks to increase our reach.

Cost Structure: Our primary costs will be software development, marketing activities, and customer support. We will keep our overhead low by outsourcing non-core activities.



Plan for Scalability: To scale the platform, we will continuously improve user experience by adding new features, expanding our network of freelancers and businesses, and exploring international markets. We will also leverage data analytics to optimize customer acquisition and increase retention.
