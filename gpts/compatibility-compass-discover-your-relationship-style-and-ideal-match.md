**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Here are some steps that Sam can take to get started:



1. Reflect on past relationships: Sam can think about their past romantic relationships and identify patterns in their behavior, emotions, and needs. Were there particular qualities or behaviors in their partners that they found attractive or unattractive? What made them feel secure or insecure in the relationship?



2. Consider emotional needs: Sam can reflect on their own emotional needs and how they like to express and receive affection. Do they value physical touch, quality time, acts of service, gifts, or words of affirmation? Understanding what makes them feel loved and supported can help Sam identify a partner who can meet those needs.



3. Evaluate communication patterns: Sam can think about their communication style and how they prefer to resolve conflicts or express their feelings. Do they prefer direct communication or subtle cues? Are they comfortable sharing vulnerability with their partner, or do they need more time to build trust? Identifying communication preferences can help Sam find a partner who is compatible with their style.



4. Explore attachment style: Sam can learn about different attachment styles, such as secure, anxious, avoidant, or disorganized, and identify which one resonates most with their experiences. Knowing their attachment style can help Sam understand their needs and vulnerabilities in relationships and find a partner who can support them.

Identify ideal partner qualities: Based on the insights gained from reflecting on past relationships, emotional needs, communication patterns, and attachment style, Sam can create a list of qualities they would like to see in an ideal partner.
