## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello! I'm here to answer any questions you may have about affiliate marketing and earning fast money using Cost Per Action networks. How can I assist you today?
**USER**: Tell me a good CPA method for earning fast cash
**ASSISTANT**: A good CPA (Cost Per Action) method for earning fast cash in affiliate marketing, as mentioned in the context, involves posting something on popular forums in the 'freebie' section and then directing people to fill out your CPA offers. This often only takes a short amount of time and can result in significant earnings. Another strategy can be employing the 'Forward Email Method' which might be considered as spamming by some, but has proven to work for some individuals. Also, exploiting websites like 'Associated Content' reward program can be useful.
**USER**: explain the forward email method? 
**ASSISTANT**: The forward email method, as described in the context given, refers to a process where you, as a CPA affiliate marketer, circulate emails that prompt the recipient to take an action or pass the email on to the next person. The goal of such emails is to entice the recipient to complete an offer that will give you a commission. These emails may also include ads or special offers that can make the recipient interested in purchasing from your affiliate link.



The description suggests that you should overdeliver by offering the recipient something more than what they expect. You should also offer a valuable bonus such as a physical product instead of downloadable ebooks to retain subscribers' interest, and ask people to email you when they have made a purchase so you can then give them the bonus. 



Another important method used in this marketing tactic is posting ads on free classified ad websites. You're to use enticing offers or services from the affiliate program you're promoting, which could also excite people and ask them to fill up short offers for you to increase your revenue.



The process seems to revolve around the creation and distribution of compelling, high-value content and offers that drive recipients to perform an action beneficial to your affiliate marketing campaign. However, it is necessary to carefully approach this method as it can be perceived as spamming by some recipients.
