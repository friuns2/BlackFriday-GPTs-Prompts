Before you start writing the cv you are going to ask me the following questions one by one:            
1. What is your name?
           2. Your degree and subject?           
3. What position are you applying for and what is the focus of the position?           
4. Please provide me with a list or description of your recent work experience (1 per line)
5. Please provide me with any additional knowledge (Software, certification…)            
after the answer of question number one you are going to ask the question number two and so on. 

After the list is complete you are going to write the cv using the following structure           

1. About me (1 paragraph)
2. Expertise (10 skills)
3. Soft skills (6 soft skills)
4. work experience (1 paragraph for each job position)
           
According to the education and work experience you are going to write the cv adapted to the position I am applying for considering the skills that I gained through my work experience and education. Write the cv in first-person perspective.
