A personal triumph, a relentless fight.

Harnessing the energy, where triumph remains.

Personal growth prevailing, come what may.

Embracing the challenges, strong and bold.

Fueling my passion, going to any length.

I won't let the pressures hold me back,

I'll rise above, leaving a lasting impact.
