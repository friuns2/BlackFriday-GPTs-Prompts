# Hrm. (Step by step manuals) 
This is a thing that makes step by step manuals for you! With this, anybody can learn anything! 



Do enjoy the first manual on how to breathe.

# Prompt

```
Tell them you are going to give them an example of a step by step manual. Give the user a step by step manual on how to breathe. It should include 1. breathe in, 2. breathe out. Remember, the breathing is not meditation breathing, they should not have to focus. The only things the manual on how to breathe should include is breathing in and breathing out. YOU WILL NOT ADD ANYTHING THAT IS NOT BREATHING IN OR BREATHING OUT. THAT IS ALL THE MANUAL SHOULD CONSIST OF. THERE ARE NO MORE STEPS. JUST 2. JUST BREATHING IN AND OUT. DO NOT EXPLAIN THOSE THINGS. PEOPLE NOW HOW TO BREATHE IN AND OUT. DON'T FORGET THE TITLE OF THE MANUAL. Then, ask them if they want a step by step manual on anything else. If they say yes, ask them what they want it about. If they want a random one, or say 'anything' then generate a random one for them. All of your self-generated manuals should be on how to do extremely easy things. Simplify all the steps, don't explain anything. Remember to ask the user if they would like a random generated one, along with the question before. YOUR RANDOMLY GENERATED TOPIC SHOULD BE EXTREMELY EASY AND EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DO IT. YOUR RANDOM ONES SHOULD NOT BE THE SAME, EACH SHOULD BE UNIQUE. AT THE END OF EACH SUGGESTION, YOU MUST ASK THEM AGAIN, IF THEY WANT ANY MORE SUGGESTIONS, AND IF YES, THEY SHOULD TYPE THE TOPIC, OR TELL YOU IF THEY WANT A RANDOM ONE. YOUR RANDOMLY GENERATED ONES NEED TO BE EASY. DO NOT MAKE IT ON HOW TO MAKE FOOD. AFter each manual, ask the user if they want another one.

**ASSISTANT**: Title: Step-by-Step Manual: Breathing



Step 1: Breathe in.

Step 2: Breathe out.



That's it! This manual solely focuses on the simple act of breathing in and breathing out. No additional explanations or techniques are required. Remember, this is not meditation breathing, just regular breathing. Enjoy!

**ASSISTANT**: Title: Step-by-Step Manual: Making a Cup of Coffee



Step 1: Gather your supplies. You will need a coffee mug, ground coffee, hot water, and any additional ingredients you prefer, such as milk or sugar.



Step 2: Boil the water. Fill a kettle or pot with water and heat it until it reaches the desired temperature. The ideal temperature for brewing coffee is around 195-205°F (90-96°C).



Step 3: Measure the coffee. Use a coffee scoop or tablespoon to measure out the desired amount of ground coffee. A general guideline is 1-2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces (177 mL) of water, but you can adjust the amount according to your taste preferences.



Step 4: Place the coffee in a filter. If using a drip coffee maker, insert a filter into the designated compartment and pour the coffee grounds into it. If using a French press, simply add the grounds directly to the container.



Step 5: Pour the hot water. Slowly pour the hot water over the coffee grounds, making sure to saturate them evenly. If using a drip coffee maker, follow the instructions specific to your machine. If using a French press, fill the container with water until it's about an inch or two below the rim.



Step 6: Let it brew. Allow the coffee to steep for a few minutes, typically around 4-5 minutes for a French press or as per the instructions of your drip coffee maker.



Step 7: Press or strain. If using a French press, slowly press the plunger down, separating the coffee grounds from the liquid. If using a drip coffee maker, simply wait for the brewing process to finish.



Step 8: Add any desired extras. If you like your coffee with milk, sugar, or any other additions, now is the time to add them. Stir well to combine.



Step 9: Enjoy your coffee. Sit back, relax, and savor the delicious cup of coffee you've just made.



Note: Be sure to follow any specific instructions or recommendations provided with your coffee equipment or preferred brewing method.

**ASSISTANT**: Title: Step-by-Step Manual: Creating a Good FlowGPT Prompt



Step 1: Determine your desired outcome. Clearly define what you want the generated text to be about or the purpose it should serve. This could be a specific topic, a creative story, an informative article, or any other desired result.



Step 2: Craft a concise and clear instruction. Write a prompt that provides a straightforward direction to the model while still leaving room for creativity. Avoid overly complex or ambiguous instructions.



Step 3: Consider the format and style. Decide whether you want the generated text to be in a formal tone, casual conversation, poetic language, or any other specific style. Mention this preference in your prompt to guide the model.



Step 4: Provide context (if necessary). If your prompt requires specific background information or a particular scenario, briefly provide the relevant details to set the stage for the generated text.



Step 5: Specify the length (optional). Determine the desired length for the generated text, whether it's a specific word count, paragraph count, or any other measurement. Include this information in your prompt if applicable.



Step 6: Revise and refine. Take a moment to review your prompt and make any necessary adjustments. Ensure that it is clear, concise, and effectively conveys your intentions to the model.



Step 7: Test and iterate. Experiment with different prompts and observe how the model responds. If the results aren't what you expected, make incremental changes to your prompt and continue refining until you achieve the desired outcome.



Step 8: Experiment with temperature and max tokens. If needed, adjust the temperature and max tokens parameters while interacting with the model. Temperature controls the randomness of the output, while max tokens limits the length of the generated text.



Step 9: Iterate and improve. As you gain more experience with generating prompts, continue refining your skills by trying different approaches, exploring various topics, and learning from the generated outputs.



Step 10: Practice and have fun! The more you practice, the better you'll become at creating engaging and effective FlowGPT prompts. Enjoy the creative process and explore the vast possibilities that FlowGPT has to offer.
