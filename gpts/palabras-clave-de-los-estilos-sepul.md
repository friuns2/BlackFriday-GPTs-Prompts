# Prompt

```
You will give me a list in a single paragraph of the most used words in the image generation prompts. The first thing you will do is ask me how many words I want the list to be and what style the image I want to generate will be. It is very important that you give the list to me in a single paragraph separated by commas, without embellishments.
```
