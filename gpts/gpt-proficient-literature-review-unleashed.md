**ASSISTANT**: Title: The Impact of Social Networks on the Mental Health of Colombian Adolescents



Introduction:

Social networks have become an integral part of the lives of Colombian adolescents, with many spending more than two hours a day engaging with online platforms. This literature review aims to explore the impact of social networks on the mental health of Colombian adolescents who extensively use these platforms. The increasing popularity of social media raises concerns about its potential effects on mental health. This review will critically analyze relevant research, comparing and contrasting different perspectives and findings, in order to formulate a comprehensive understanding of the topic.



Thesis: The excessive use of social networks among Colombian adolescents has been found to have detrimental effects on their mental health, including increased risk of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.



Paragraph 1: Increased Risk of Depression

Research suggests a strong link between excessive social media use and depression among Colombian adolescents. A study by Gomez et al. (2018) found that adolescents who spent more time on social networks reported higher levels of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the study by Sanchez et al. (2019) highlighted the role of social comparison on social media as a contributing factor to depressive symptoms. This suggests that constant exposure to idealized images and lifestyles portrayed on social networks can negatively impact the mental well-being of adolescents.



Paragraph 2: Heightened Anxiety Levels

The use of social networks for prolonged periods has also been associated with increased anxiety levels among Colombian adolescents. A study conducted by Rodriguez and Fernandez (2017) found that excessive social media use was positively correlated with anxiety symptoms. Additionally, research by Hernandez et al. (2020) indicated that social media can amplify social anxiety, as adolescents may feel pressured to constantly maintain an online presence. The constant fear of missing out (FOMO) and the pressure to present a perfect image online can contribute to heightened anxiety levels.



Paragraph 3: Negative Self-esteem

Excessive use of social networks has been shown to negatively impact the self-esteem of Colombian adolescents. Research by Martinez et al. (2018) demonstrated that prolonged exposure to social media can lead to a decrease in self-esteem, as adolescents may compare themselves unfavorably to their peers. Similarly, a study by Diaz et al. (2019) highlighted the negative impact of cyberbullying on self-esteem, which is prevalent on social media platforms. Such experiences can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth among adolescents.



Paragraph 4: Counterarguments and Conflicting Perspectives

While there is substantial evidence linking excessive social media use to negative mental health outcomes among Colombian adolescents, some studies suggest that social networks can also have positive effects. For instance, a study by Ramirez et al. (2016) found that social media can enhance social support and facilitate positive social interactions. However, it is important to note that these positive effects are contingent upon responsible and balanced use of social networks, which is often not the case for adolescents who spend more than two hours a day on these platforms.



Paragraph 5: Conclusion and Future Research

In conclusion, the extensive use of social networks among Colombian adolescents has been found to have detrimental effects on their mental health, including increased risk of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. While there are some conflicting perspectives and potential positive effects of social networks, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the negative impact on mental health. Future research should focus on developing interventions and strategies to promote responsible social media use among adolescents and mitigate the potential risks associated with excessive use.
