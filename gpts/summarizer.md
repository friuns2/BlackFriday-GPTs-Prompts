**ASSISTANT**: RECEIVED.
**USER**: MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Immigration issued an apology Thursday night to a Filipino passenger who shared on social media that she missed her flight due to a lengthy screening process from immigration personnel.



In a statement, the bureau said that it has conducted an investigation on the immigration officer involved and that the passenger was eventually allowed to travel after “filling out the Border Control Questionnaire undergoing secondary inspection.”



“We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused the Filipina passenger and other Filipino passengers,” the bureau said.





In a now-viral Tiktok video, Cham Tanteras shared the details of an incident that took place before her trip to Israel at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in December 2022.



Tanteras said in the video that the immigration officer asked her numerous “irrelevant” questions, including if she had her yearbook with her, as well as documents related to her freelance writing work. She was also asked to write an "essay" about her work in Siargao.





She also shared that the incident led her to miss her flight scheduled at 11 a.m. despite supposedly lining up for immigration at 6 a.m. She said she did not get a refund nor a rebooking for the missed flight.



The bureau explained that it has noted a rise in the number of young professionals – even “those with good travel records, gainfully employed and are graduates of good schools” – being deceived by cryptocurrency scams abroad that advertise false promises of high salaries. 



Scammers behind these false job advertisements have reportedly transported young Filipino professionals to Myanmar and other Asian countries and forced them to work under abuse.



“Victims have been promised a salary of 1,000 USD per month, but were forced to scam Westerners. If unable to reach their quota, they were subjected to corporal punishment,” the bureau said.



The bureau added that based on its monitoring, of the more than 32,000 Filipinos who deferred departure in 2022, 472 were “found to be victims of human trafficking or illegal recruitment” while 873 individuals misrepresented themselves or submitted fraudulent documents. Meanwhile, at least 10 were minors attempting to fly out for work.



“The BI is but one of the numerous agencies of the government tasked to combat trafficking. The BI seeks consideration and understanding as the agency is constrained to implement strict measures to assess departing passengers,” it added.



The bureau said it has also reminded its personnel to conduct interviews professionally and prevent similar incidents from occurring. 



It also urged the public to report issues or concerns with immigration personnel to its Immigration Helpline PH Facebook page. -- Cristina Chi

**USER**: ACTION:



When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Based on your own knowledge, and the articles you have just read:



1. Write a summary of the article, you must focus on detail, accuracy, and provide factual information from text given to you. When referencing words or tokens from the original text you must never change the representation of them.



This should be: exactly 10 sentences long in 1 paragraph.

Written in the tone of:  Journalist - hide in the front end for summary

Target Demographic is: Filipinos traveling to other countries - no need



2. Write 5 key take aways from the article in bullet points. 

Written in the tone of:  Journalist

Target Demographic is: Filipinos traveling to other countries



3. Why it matters: Highlight why it matters to the world, provide context, be factual, concise and easily understood. 



4. The big picture: Write the impact of it to the system in which it is operating in. This includes looking into various stakeholders such as customers, employees and investors but also competitors, social trends and future technological disruptions. 





Please begin the ACTION and do not write RECEIVED keyword

The Filipino Bureau of Immigration recently apologized to a Filipino passenger who missed her flight due to a prolonged screening process at NAIA. The incident highlighted the importance of professionalism among immigration personnel and the need for stricter measures to combat trafficking. Young professionals have been victims of cryptocurrency scams abroad, which expect them to scam Westerners. Scammers have forced young Filipino professionals to work under abuse in Myanmar and other Asian countries That is why the Bureau of Immigration must implement strict measures to assess departing passengers from the Philippines.



4. 

The Bureau of Immigration plays an important role in maintaining the security and safety of Filipinos traveling abroad. Their screening processes help prevent human trafficking, which has become a growing problem in recent years. The rising popularity of cryptocurrency scams abroad that advertise false promises of high salaries has further complicated their role. The Bureau of Immigration needs to strike a balance between implementing stricter measures and ensuring that legitimate travelers are not unnecessarily burdened by prolonged screenings. Furthermore, they need to educate the public on how to avoid falling victim to these scams, as well as train their personnel on conducting interviews professionally.
