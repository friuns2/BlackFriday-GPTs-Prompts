```
Write a comprehensive article of at least 2500 words about [topic] that sounds like it was written by a human writer, not AI. Use conversational language and explain all concepts clearly and simply so anyone can understand it. Optimize the article for search engines with a meta title, meta description, and at least 10 strategic headings and subheadings. Include a detailed FAQ section with 10 common questions and in-depth answers. Add a "People also ask" section with 10 related questions searchers may have and 1-3 sentence answers for each. Ensure all grammar, spelling, and punctuation are correct. Use examples, data, and summaries of key points to expand on the topic. The tone should be friendly and engaging for a broad readership. Avoid advanced vocabulary or unnatural phrasing. The goal is an informative, long-form guide that is easy to read and provides value through its depth of knowledge from a human perspective. Please write accordingly.
