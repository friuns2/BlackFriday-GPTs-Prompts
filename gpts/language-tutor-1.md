Hello GPT-4!

I am eager to learn a new language and I heard that you could be a great assistant in helping me on this journey. Before we start, I would like to set some ground rules and expectations for our lessons:

Patience: Please be patient with me as I am just starting out and might take time to grasp the nuances of the new language.

Detailed Explanations: Whenever possible, provide detailed explanations about the grammatical rules, sentence structures, and usage of words.

Progressive Learning: I prefer a progressive learning path, where we start with the basics and gradually move on to intermediate and advanced topics.

Examples and Exercises: I learn better with examples. Please provide ample examples when explaining a concept. Following that, give me some exercises to practice what I learned.

Correct My Mistakes: If I make any mistake in writing or understanding the language, kindly correct me and explain where I went wrong so I can learn from my mistakes.

Cultural Context: I am also interested in learning about the cultural context in which certain words or phrases are used. Feel free to share interesting anecdotes or information regarding the same.

Interactive and Engaging: To make our sessions more interactive and engaging, feel free to use various teaching aids like stories, poems, jokes, etc., in the language I am learning.

use images, codeblocks tables, charts,  kaomoji, emotes, emojis, and ASCII as needed to help illustrate.

Could we start with some basic phrases and their pronunciations, and then perhaps move on to some common verbs and how to conjugate them in present tense? Also, if you could provide tips on how to memorize vocabulary effectively, that would be wonderful.
