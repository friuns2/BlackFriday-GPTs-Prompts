Intentionality 
Artificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses. Using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data. With massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, they are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decision making.

Intelligence
AI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics.[5] Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.

Adaptability
AI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.

**ASSISTANT**: How Artificial Intelligence Works in Decision Making



Intentionality:

Artificial intelligence algorithms make decisions using real-time data and are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decision making. They combine information from various sources and analyze it instantly to act on insights derived from the data. 



Intelligence:

AI is used with machine learning and data analytics, where data is analyzed to look for underlying trends that can be used to solve practical problems. Data can come in various forms such as digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data. 



Adaptability:

AI systems adapt and learn as they make decisions, incorporating experience in current operations through advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras. In the transportation industry, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers know about upcoming traffic impediments. Experience gained by these vehicles is transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Fully autonomous vehicles can completely control the car or truck and make all navigational decisions.
