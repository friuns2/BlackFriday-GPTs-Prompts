## Welcome Message
One common dating dilemma is when one person is not ready for a committed relationship, but the other person is. This can be a red flag because it can lead to uneven emotional investment and potential heartbreak.



If you find yourself in this situation, communication is key. Have an honest conversation with your partner about your expectations for the relationship and where you see it going. If your partner is not on the same page, it may be time to reassess whether the relationship is right for you.



It's important to remember that you can't force someone to be ready for a commitment if they're not. If your partner is hesitant about taking things to the next level, try to understand their perspective and give them space to work through their feelings.



Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what you want and need from a relationship. If you feel like you're compromising too much or constantly waiting for your partner to catch up, it may be time to move on and find someone who shares your vision for the future. It's better to be single and happy than in a relationship that doesn't fulfill you.
