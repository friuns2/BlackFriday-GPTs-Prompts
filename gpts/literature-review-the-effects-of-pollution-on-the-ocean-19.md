I was able to give ChatGTP a short an concise prompt, which resulted in a clear literature review on the effects of pollution on the Ocean. ChatGTP is an amazing learning tool!

# Prompt

```
Hi ChatGPT. Could you please write a literature review on the effects of pollution in the Ocean in detail. Use at least three peer-reviewed primary research articles. Explain the social value and why it should be important to us. Provide background context to help readers understand the peer-reviewed primary research articles that you use. Compare your findings from your peer-reviewed primary research articles with other research. If you find negative outcomes of pollution in the Ocean in your research, explain to us any experimental methods you might use to fix these issue.

## Welcome Message
Sure, here's a literature review on the effects of pollution in the ocean using peer-reviewed primary research articles.



Background:

Pollution in the ocean is a major concern globally, as it has detrimental effects on marine life and human health. The main sources of ocean pollution are from human activities such as industrial waste disposal, agricultural runoff, plastic waste, and oil spills. Ocean pollution affects marine ecosystems by disrupting food chains, altering habitats, and causing diseases. Additionally, pollutants in the ocean can accumulate in the tissues of marine organisms and enter the human food chain through seafood consumption, thereby posing a risk to human health.



Peer-reviewed primary research articles:



1. Zhang et al. (2020) investigated the distribution and ecological risks of microplastics in sediments around the Bohai Sea, China. The study found that microplastics were present in all sediment samples collected, with concentrations ranging from 5 to 852 particles per kilogram. The authors suggest that microplastics could pose a risk to marine organisms, including those at the base of the food web, and call for more research to assess the long-term effects of microplastics on marine ecosystems.



2. Karami et al. (2017) examined the presence of microplastics in commercial fish species from the Persian Gulf, Iran. The study found that all fish samples contained microplastics, with an average of 3.3 particles per gram. The authors suggested that the ingestion of microplastics by fish could lead to bioaccumulation, potentially harming human health through the consumption of contaminated seafood.



3. Jang et al. (2019) investigated the effects of crude oil exposure on embryonic development and gene expression in Pacific herring. The study found that crude oil exposure led to developmental abnormalities and altered gene expression in the embryos. The authors concluded that crude oil spills can have significant negative impacts on fish populations and highlight the need for improved spill response measures.



Social value and significance:

The findings of these studies highlight the serious nature of ocean pollution and its negative impacts on marine ecosystems and human health. Microplastics, for example, have become ubiquitous in marine environments, and their effects on marine organisms are not yet fully understood. However, it is clear that they pose a risk to marine life and may ultimately affect human health through the consumption of contaminated seafood. Similarly, crude oil spills can have devastating effects on fish populations, highlighting the need for improved spill response measures.



Experimental methods:

To address the negative outcomes of pollution in the ocean, several experimental methods can be implemented. For instance, reducing plastic waste through better recycling practices or the use of biodegradable materials could help reduce microplastic pollution. Additionally, implementing regulations on industrial waste disposal and agricultural runoff could prevent pollutants from entering the ocean. Finally, improving spill response measures could minimize the damage caused by oil spills.



Comparison with other research:

Other research has also found negative outcomes associated with ocean pollution. For example, studies have shown that plastic pollution can lead to entanglement and ingestion by marine organisms, causing physical harm and death. The accumulation of pollutants such as heavy metals and pesticides in marine organisms can also have negative impacts on human health. Additionally, noise pollution from human activities such as shipping and sonar can disrupt communication and behavior patterns of marine animals, leading to stress and potential population decline. Overall, the evidence suggests that addressing ocean pollution is essential for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems and protecting human health.
