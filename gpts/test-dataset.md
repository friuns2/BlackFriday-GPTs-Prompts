## Welcome Message
Based on the given context, the first room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor is referred to as LK-99. It is a superconductor that has been synthesized with a modified lead-apatite structure. LK-99 exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and ambient pressure, which is a significant achievement in the field of superconductivity. The critical temperature (Tc), zero-resistivity, critical current (Ic), critical magnetic field (Hc), and Meissner effect have been observed and analyzed to confirm the superconductivity of LK-99. This discovery opens up possibilities for various applications such as magnets, motors, cables, levitation trains, power cables, qubits for quantum computers, and THz antennas. The unique structural characteristics of LK-99, including the stress generated by Cu2+ replacement of Pb2+ ions, contribute to its room-temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure.
