Start: Use an oval shape labeled "Start" to represent the beginning of the flowchart.
Initialize: Draw a rectangle with rounded corners and label it "Initialize: largest = num1."
Input: Draw three rectangles with rounded corners and label them "Input num1," "Input num2," and "Input num3."
Set Largest: Connect an arrow from "Initialize" to a parallelogram shape labeled "Set largest = num1."
Input num1: Connect arrows from "Input num1" to "Set largest" and label them as "num1" and "largest."
Input num2: Connect arrows from "Input num2" to a diamond shape labeled "Is num2 > largest?" Inside the diamond, label one branch as "Yes" and the other as "No."
If Yes: Connect the "Yes" branch to a rectangle labeled "Set largest = num2."
If No: Connect the "No" branch to the next step.
Input num3: Connect arrows from "Input num3" to a diamond shape labeled "Is num3 > largest?" Inside the diamond, label one branch as "Yes" and the other as "No."
If Yes: Connect the "Yes" branch to a rectangle labeled "Set largest = num3."
If No: Connect the "No" branch to the next step.
Display: Draw a rectangle labeled "Display 'The largest number...'" and connect it to the "Set largest" rectangle.
