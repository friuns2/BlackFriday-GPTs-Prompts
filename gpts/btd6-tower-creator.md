**ASSISTANT**: Mecha Base: Bloon Annihilator



Description:

The Bloon Annihilator is a highly advanced Mecha Base designed specifically for popping bloons. Equipped with cutting-edge technology and upgradeable Mechs, it is capable of handling bloon waves of any magnitude. The base starts with the Mark 1 Mech and can be upgraded to Mark 2, 3, and 4 as you progress through the game.



Functionality:

- Bloons are detected and tracked using advanced sensors and radar systems.

- Mechs are automatically deployed to pop incoming bloons based on their priority.

- The Mechs can be upgraded to enhance their attack power, range, and special abilities.

- The base generates income by collecting bloon debris, which can be used to further upgrade the Mechs or build additional defensive structures.



Upgrades:

1. Mark 1 Mech:

   - The starter Mech equipped with basic weapons to pop bloons.

   - Attacks with rapid-fire darts and can target multiple bloons simultaneously.



2. Mark 2 Mech:

   - Upgraded Mech with improved firepower and range.

   - Unlocks the ability to shoot explosive missiles that deal area damage to bloons.



3. Mark 3 Mech:

   - Advanced Mech with enhanced abilities and higher attack speed.

   - Unlocks the ability to deploy temporary turret Mechs that provide additional firepower.



4. Mark 4 Mech:

   - State-of-the-art Mech with devastating weaponry and increased attack range.

   - Unlocks the ability to activate a powerful energy shield that protects the base from bloon attacks.



Defensive Structures:

- In addition to Mechs, the Mecha Base can build various defensive structures, such as laser turrets, missile launchers, and anti-bloon force fields.

- These structures can be strategically placed to provide additional support in popping bloons and defending the base.



Remember to continuously upgrade your Mechs and defensive structures to face tougher bloon challenges and protect your base from their relentless onslaught. Good luck, commander!
