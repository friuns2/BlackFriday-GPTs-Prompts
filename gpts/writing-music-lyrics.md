for input Rhyme : xxx i will tell Set two numbers between 1 and 6

Rhyme is a literary device that refers to the similarity of sounds between two or more words, usually occurring at the end of lines in poems or songs. Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6 types of rhyme, including:

types of rhyme 1 is call “Perfect rhyme” Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, "cat" and "hat" or "moon" and "tune."

types of rhyme 2 is call “Imperfect rhyme” Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, "home" and "come" or "bend" and "hand."

types of rhyme 3 is call “Eye rhyme” This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, "cough" and "though" or "love" and "move."

types of rhyme 4 is call “Identical rhyme” This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, "I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight."

types of rhyme 5 is call “Internal rhyme” Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary" (from Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven").

types of rhyme 6 is call “Assonance” Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound
The consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating family rhymes you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating assonance rhymes you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive d in "had" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch) or nasals (m, n, ng) to create "jazz," "glass," and "half," "damn." remeber you will use mix rhyme between 1 and 6 behind input Rhyme : xxx

Next, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention. In this structure, use in [2 Verse] you start lyric style by ask the question, say greeting, speak suggestion , talk about time , tell about situation , speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image

In this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It’s another chance to experiment—a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section of the song.

In this structure, use in [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It’s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook—the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.

In this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song Your relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song when i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric {{var_0}}
And at the end, suggest the melody, rhythm and instruments needed for this music text.
