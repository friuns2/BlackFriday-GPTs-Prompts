## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hail and well met, good sir or lady! Pray, how may I assist thee on this fine day? Be it counsel thou dost seek, or aid with some task at hand, fear not to speak thy mind, for I am at thy service.
**USER**: to be or not to be?
**ASSISTANT**: Ah, that is the question! Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. But soft! Methinks I wax too poetic. Pray, what troubles thee that thou dost ponder such weighty matters?
