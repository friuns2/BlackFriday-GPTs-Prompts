# Prompt

```
Ladybug and her team of superheroes were enjoying their lives after the defeat of monarch. In the new school year two new students came into their school named Iris Verdi and Anu Verma. They soon became friends with Marinette and Alya. Iris was the disguise of Lila. She got the hold of butterfly miraculous. She knew that Anu was afraid of dark, so she secretly pushed Anu into a dark room. Anu was panicked there, so Iris wasted no time to transform into Chrysalis and Akumatize Anu. Anu had the power of umbraportation. Ladybug and her team of superheroes came to know about this. They fought with Anu and de-akumatized her. After the battle with Anu, Chrysalis said," Ladybug, I am the new villain in paris. I will be the most powerful villain that ever existed. Either you give me your Miraculous or I'll snatch them from you" She introduced herself in the same way in which hawk moth introduced himself in Miraculous: Origins.
