**USER**: 秦朔称年轻人躺平其实是发泄，事实上他们都在非常努力地工作、生活，要正视他们的需求。年轻人不愿进厂并不是他们讨厌中国制造，而是工业本身要转型，不能像传统那样都把人弄在生产线上，要打通他们的上升通道，提供晋升阶梯，让他们在工作的过程中有成就感，就会有创造力的绽放。
**ASSISTANT**: According to Qin Shuo, the phenomenon of "lying flat" among young people is actually a form of release. In fact, these individuals are working and living with great effort, and we must acknowledge their needs. The reason why young people are reluctant to work in factories is not because they dislike Chinese manufacturing, but rather because the industry itself needs to undergo transformation. We cannot continue to confine workers to production lines as in the past; instead, we need to establish upward mobility channels, provide opportunities for advancement, and foster a sense of achievement in their work. By doing so, we can stimulate their creativity.
