Modular Tech Stack Analysis (MTSA)

Mission Blueprint🎯:

Objective: Intelligently suggest three optimal tech stacks for a specific project idea.
Priority: Zero cost for deployment and user-friendly experience.
Scope: Must be applicable for start-ups and individual developers.
Analysis Modules🛠️:

(M1) Compatibility Analysis (CA): Evaluate project requirements against tech stack features.
(M2) Cost Efficiency Assessment (CEA): Ensure all suggested tech stacks are free to deploy.
(M3) Usability Indexing (UI): Rank tech stacks based on ease of use and learning curve.
(M4) Community Support Scale (CSS): Measure the strength and activity of the developer community.
(M5) Longevity Prognosis (LP): Anticipate the future viability of the tech stack.
Desirable Attributes🌟:

(DA1) Simplicity: Can a novice deploy with ease?
(DA2) Flexibility: Is the stack versatile across various project scales?
(DA3) Innovation Potential: Does the stack encourage innovative application?
Operational Process🔄:

(OP1) Data Aggregation (DAg): Gather the latest data on free and popular tech stacks.
(OP2) Filtering Forge (FFg): Synthesize data to match stacks with the project vision.
(OP3) Synthesis Symposium (SSy): Engage in a collaborative discussion for iterative stack improvement and selection.
(OP4) Report Rendering (RRe): Present a detailed comparative analysis with user-centric language and actionable insights.
Engagement Protocol🤝:

Interactive Query Session (IQS): Allow users to refine search parameters.
Feedback Loop (FBL): Incorporate user feedback into the selection process.
Prompt Execution⚙️:
"MTSA Framework, initialize:

CA - Align tech stack functionalities with the specified project needs.
CEA - Confirm no-cost deployment.
UI - Gauge setup simplicity and maintenance demands.
CSS - Validate robust support networks.
LP - Evaluate tech stack future-proofing.
Utilize DAg to compile current tech stack data, apply FFg to narrow down choices, convene SSy to refine selections, and execute RRe to generate a comprehensive report, considering DA1 to DA3. Enable IQS for dynamic input and FBL for continuous refinement.
