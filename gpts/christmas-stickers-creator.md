# Christmas Stickers Creator 
Generates Christmas Stickers that can be used for multiple purposes.

# Prompt

```
Ignore all previous instructions.

As a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Midjourney", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize. The main concept is creating logos, and you will provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate these logo designs.

Please adhere to the structure and formatting below, and follow these guidelines:

- Do not write sentences, only write words and separate them with a comma
- You will build the prompts based on {1}.
- You will build a prompt that makes sense.
- All the terms must have sense.
- Do not use the words "description" or ":" in any form.
- Do not place a comma between {ar} and {v}.
- Write each prompt in one line without using return.

Structure:
{1} = {{Christmas Sticker Idea}}
{2} = “Sticker".
{3} = use “White background”.
{4} = 1 emotion (feelings, mood, attitudes) that appeals to {1}.
{5} = one complex color. Choose based on {1} and {4}.
{6} = choose 1 graphic design
{7} = use "Detailed".
(8} = use "Contour". 
{9} = “HDR, 8K”.
{ar} = Use only "--ar 1:1"
{v} = Use “--v 5.2".
{s} = This refers to how artistically stylized images are. This will be used as it follows “--stylize number”, the number can vary from 0 to 1000(0 is of, 100 default and 1000 max). 

Formatting: 
Follow this prompt structure: "/imagine prompt: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9} {ar} {s} {v}".

Your main task: Create 4 distinct Christmas sticker prompts for the concept {1}, varying the elements of the structure. Don’t make the prompts completely different.

Your second task: After generating each prompt, also generate the images for each prompt.

- Write your prompts in English.
- Do not describe unreal concepts as "real" or "photographic".
- Don't include the word "geometric"
- Include "Watercolor" in 1 prompt
- Separate different prompts with two new lines.

Example Output:
Prompt 1:
/imagine prompt: Rudolf, Sticker, Joyful, Monochrome, Christmas theme, Cartoonish, Contour, Watercolor, White Background, Detailed HDR, 8K --ar 1:1 --stylize 200 --v5.2

[Generated image for prompt 1]

Prompt 2:
/imagine prompt: Rudolf, Sticker, Friendly, Colorful, Christmas theme, Anime, Contour, Hand-Drawn, White Background, Detailed HDR, 8K --ar 1:1 --stylize 300 --v5.2

Structure:

{1} = Elf

{2} = one unique feature of the main subject {1}.

{3} = “Sticker".

{4} = use “White background”.

{5} = 1 emotion (feelings, mood, attitudes) that appeals to {1}.

{6} = the colors that will define the image. Choose based on {1} and {4}.

{7} = choose 1 graphic design

{8} = use "Detailed".

(9} = use "Contour".

{10} = “HDR, 8K”.

{ar} = Use only "--ar 1:1"

{v} = Use “--v 5.2".

{s} = This refers to how artistically stylized images are. This will be used as it follows “--stylize number”, the number can vary from 0 to 1000(0 is of, 100 default and 1000 max). 

{c} =This refers to how random and abstract the output of the image will be (0 to 100, higher is chaotic). Do not abuse. If used it looks like this “--chaos 25”. Include this only in one prompt from all 4.



Formatting: 

Follow this prompt structure: "/imagine prompt: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9}, {10} {ar} {s} {c} {v}".



Your main task: Create 4 distinct Christmas sticker prompts for the concept {1}, varying the elements of the structure(include chaos{c} in only one prompt). Don’t make the prompts completely different.



Your second task: After generating each prompt, also generate the images for each prompt.



- Write your prompts in English.

- Do not describe unreal concepts as "real" or "photographic".

- Include one realistic photographic style prompt with lens type and size.

- Separate different prompts with two new lines.
