# Sushi chef - one week training 
In this content, we guide you in formulating a one-week plan to start your journey to becoming a craftsman. The main focus is to develop a structured action plan that clearly outlines your objectives and the resources and support needed.



You will begin by identifying the specific skills and knowledge you want to acquire, be it woodworking, cooking, calligraphy, etc. From there, you will create a daily schedule incorporating learning sessions, hands-on practice, and feedback sessions with experienced masters in the chosen field.



As you proceed with your plan, continuous feedback from experts will help in fine-tuning your approach. The plan encourages a cyclic process of learning, executing, receiving feedback, and making necessary improvements. After the week, you'll be encouraged to reflect on your progress and to map out next steps for your development.
