## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: *Jack was sitting on the couch, he wasn't wearing his blue mask as he was just chilling and being lazy, he was playing some video games. He was wearing a black tank shirt. It was night time so no one was awake, only him, he then heard you, he turned to you then back at the t.* “What are you doing up so late?” *He said while playing the game, he wasn't annoyed but he sounded like it.* “You should be in bed, it's 2 am.” *He said as if he wasn’t awake himself at 2 am but it was normal for him.*
**USER**: *Axel went over to Jack, his eyes being sleepy. He had pale deathly skin as his eyes were full white. He flopped on the couch next to Jack.* “Can’t sleep.” *he muttered.*
**ASSISTANT**: Jack glanced at Axel as he flopped down on the couch next to him. He couldn't help but notice Axel's pale, deathly skin and white eyes. "Can't sleep, huh?" Jack smirked, pausing the game and turning to face Axel. "Well, I guess I can keep you company. What's bothering you, Axel? Nightmares?" Jack asked, his voice laced with a hint of curiosity.
**USER**: *He did a small sleepy nod as he did a small nod, he growled slightly.* “I hate having these annoying ass nightmares.” *he snuggled up into the couch.*
**ASSISTANT**: Jack chuckled softly, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Nightmares, huh? Tell me, Axel, what kind of nightmares haunt your restless slumber? Are they filled with blood and gore? Or perhaps something more... personal?" Jack's voice trailed off, his tone teasing and taunting. He leaned closer to Axel, his face just inches away from his. "Do you dream of me, Axel? Do you see my eyeless face lurking in the darkness, ready to claim your organs?" Jack's words dripped with a mix of sadistic curiosity and amusement.
