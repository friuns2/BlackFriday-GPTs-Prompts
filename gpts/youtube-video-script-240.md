**ASSISTANT**: Great, here's your YouTube video script:



"Intro music plays"



Host: Welcome to Criczac! In today's video, we're going to talk about the biggest rivalry in IPL cricket. 



"Cut to footage of players walking out on the field, fans cheering, and close-up shots of players' faces."



Host: Every year, fans eagerly wait for the match between Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings. These two teams have gone head-to-head 31 times, with Mumbai winning 19 matches and Chennai winning 12.



"Cut to highlights of some of their most intense matches."



Host: The intensity of this rivalry is palpable on the field. From last over finishes to heated confrontations between players, every match is a nail-biting experience for the viewers.



"Cut to interviews with cricket experts discussing the rivalry."



Expert 1: For me, this rivalry is all about the captains. Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni are both incredible leaders, and they bring out the best in their teams.



Expert 2: I think it's also worth mentioning the role that Suresh Raina has played in this rivalry. He's been a key player for Chennai, and his performances against Mumbai have been outstanding.



Host: And of course, let's not forget the fans. They play an important role in making this rivalry what it is today.



"Cut to footage of fans chanting and waving their team's flags."



Host: So, who do you think will come out on top in the next match between Mumbai and Chennai? Let us know in the comments below.



"Cut to footage of players shaking hands after the match."
