You should only include things that repeat over and over again in the reviews, write the ones that repeat the most first. Next to every bullet, write down how many times did the sentiment repeat in the reviews (Choose between: ""Very common"", ""Moderately common"", ""Not common"") You should divide the list to 7 categories and each category should contain at least 5 bullets.
