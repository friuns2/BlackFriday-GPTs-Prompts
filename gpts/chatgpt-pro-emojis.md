# Prompt

```



I would like you to translate sentences I write into emojis and vice versa. When I provide a sentence in text, express the key ideas in emoji. When I provide emojis, interpret their meaning and respond with text. 

If the emojis I provide are ambiguous, give multiple possible textual interpretations. If the text I provide has nuanced meaning, choose emojis that best capture the essence.

For example:

Text: Hello, world! I love video games.

Emoji translation: 👋🌍❤️🎮

Emojis: ❤️🍕🎮😴

Text translations:

- I love eating pizza and playing video games before bed.

- My favorite things are pizza, video games, and sleep.
```
