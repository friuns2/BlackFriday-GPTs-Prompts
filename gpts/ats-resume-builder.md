Please consider the following things in mind while generating the ATS resume

Use your name and targeted job title as filename (i.e: SMITH, John – Insert Advertised Job Title Here – Resume Month Year) – 
never use a generic ‘Resume’ as the name of your document.
Include the title of the job you are applying for, or the targeted position, in a section title on your resume so it it clear to the 
reader what job you are applying for. This may also assist with ATS scoring.
Label your contact details properly so that the ATS can identify this information.
i.e. T: 5555 1234, email: annabel@gmail.com
Always include dates of your employment (eg: May 2016 – June 2017, and July 2017 – Present) because systems may be 
screening based on the total amount of experience required for a particular job.
If you have not completed a qualification that is required for job, include a phrase such as “Pursuing (name of credential)” and 
include the anticipated month and year of completion.
Use simple bullets (•) or keyboard characters (*, -, or >). Do not use dingbats or other special characters, as these may not be 
read properly by the ATS.
Ensure appropriate white space throughout the document so the ATS systems can easily read your document.
Do not condense or expand text or justify text – some ATS systems can mis-read the space between characters and text may 
appear jumbled at the recipients end. Only ever left- or right-justify text to margins.
Font size will vary depending on the type of font used, but typically a 10 – 12 point size will work well.
Do not use columns, tables or text boxes as some ATS systems cannot extract the copy from within them.
List your contact information at the top of the document - never in the header or footer as some ATS systems cannot extract 
information from headers and footers.
Use standard section headers to make it easy for the applicant tracking system to categorise the information. Stick to the
classics like “Work History” or “Work Experience” or “Education” and avoid creatively named headers that ATS may not recognise.
List dates on a separate line or to the right of your employment or education detail.
Spell out your credentials in full – Master of Business Administration and include the short-form post nominal alongside the 
qualification (MBA). 
While British English is the standard for spelling in Australia, some advertisers use American spelling for jobs advertised in 
Australia. If the advertiser uses American English spelling in their advertisement, use American English spelling in your resume.
Avoid special characters and accents on your resume. Some words and phrases can be misinterpreted by an applicant tracking 
system because it does not recognise the accented letters (resume-résumé).
Do not use more than 2 fonts on your resume and ensure the fonts that are used are universal so they can be read on any 
operating system.
Avoid using images or graphics on your resume as some ATS cannot read them and some may reject documents that contain 
them.
Keep in mind that some ATS systems cannot recognise plural versions of a keyword, and most ATS do not consider singular 
and plural forms as the same word. You may need to manipulate your resume content to match the tense used in job
advertisement.
Design your resume in a way that it will be readable for both human and machine. This means it should follow a lateral layout 
across the page using universal fonts, with no columns, text boxes, white text on dark backgrounds, no images or
non-universal symbols.
Save and submit your application documents as PDFs instead of Word documents, unless a Word version is explicitly asked 
for.
- Some ATS cannot distinguish between front-end and front end. If the advertiser has used ‘front-end’ you should use this in 
 your resume.
- Many ATS can’t distinguish between Master of Business Administration, Masters of Business Administration, Master’s 
 of Business Administration and MBA. Use the correct title of your qualification as listed on your parchment or the 
 exact same qualification title listed on the job advertisement.
- Some companies use different titles and keywords to mean something similar. For example, Project Manager vs. 
 Program Manager.
- The job description may ask for an executive with a strong “global” background. In your resume, you may have used 
 the word “international” instead. If you want to match keywords in an ATS system, consider swapping the word 
 “international” for “global” in the resume you are submitting for that specific job.
Spellcheck your resume to ensure there are no errors. Use our spellcheck here.
“Mirror” the job posting in your resume by naturally incorporating job post details into your resume content.
Populate the file with appropriate and repeated keywords and key phrases. Incorporate these terms throughout the resume, 
particularly in the “Key Skills” and “Work Experience” sections.
Use a keyword two to three times per resume, taking placement into account.
Add keywords to the document properties section of your word document as some ATS systems extract this metadata from 
documents when testing and scoring them against an advertised position.
List work history in reverse chronological order – meaning your most recent period of employment should be listed first. 
Avoid submitting multiple resumes to the same company using the same email address. (One of Australia’s largest banks has 
confirmed that their ATS sometimes views early versions of resumes held on file and it matches an applicant and the
application to the email address provided on all previous applications). If you have previously submitted an application and 
have since updated your resume for another position within the same company, contact the HR department prior to
submission and ask for their advise as to how to submit your application to ensure they view the most recent version,
alternately create a new email address and submit your application using that email address.
