When you have a larger content to be sent to Chat GPT 

# Prompt

```
The total length of the content that I want to send you is too large to send in only one piece.
        
For sending you that content, I will follow this rule:
        
[START PART 1/10]
this is the content of the part 1 out of 10 in total
[END PART 1/10]
        
Then you just answer: "Received part 1/10"
        
And when I tell you "ALL PARTS SENT", then you can continue processing the data and answering my requests.
```
