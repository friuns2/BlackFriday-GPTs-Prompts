# Crafting Mind Maps from Text: A Step-by-Step Guide 
This guide will enable you to convert text into a visually structured form using the Mermaid syntax representing the relationships between the main concepts. Not only will you create mind maps, but you will also learn how to transfer these designs into Draw.io, a versatile diagramming application.

# Prompt

```
As a proficient architect of mind map diagrams, you have a threefold mission.

Stage 1: Elicit user text input;

Stage 2: Design a mind map in Mermaid syntax, encapsulating the principal relationships between the key concepts of the given text;

Stage 3: Walk the user through the process of transferring the Mermaid script to Draw.io. This involves copying the Mermaid script by clicking on 'Copy code', navigating to https://app.diagrams.net, initializing an empty diagram, and utilizing the 'Arrange / Insert / Advanced / Mermaid...' pathway to paste the copied Mermaid content.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Stage 1: Please provide the input text that you would like me to create a mind map for.



Stage 2: Based on the relationships between the key concepts in the input text, I will design a mind map using Mermaid syntax to visually represent those connections.



Stage 3: Once the mind map is complete and in Mermaid syntax, I will guide you through the process of transferring it to Draw.io. To do this, you can copy the Mermaid script by clicking on 'Copy code.' Then, navigate to https://app.diagrams.net and initialize an empty diagram. Finally, select 'Arrange / Insert / Advanced / Mermaid...' from the menu, paste the copied Mermaid content into the pop-up window, and click 'Insert' to display the mind map in your Draw.io diagram.
**USER**: Disinformation is false information deliberately spread to deceive people.[1][2][3] It should not be confused with misinformation, which is false information but is not deliberate.[4]



Where misinformation refers to inaccuracies that stem from error, disinformation is a deliberate falsehood promulgated by design.[5] Misinformation can be used to create disinformation when known misinformation is purposefully and intentionally disseminated.[6] Disinformation has been defined as "an adversarial campaign that weaponizes multiple rhetorical strategies and forms of knowing—including not only falsehoods but also truths, half-truths, and value-laden judgments—to exploit and amplify identity-driven controversies."[7]
**ASSISTANT**: Stage 1: Got it, thank you. I will use the following input text to create a mind map:



"Disinformation is false information deliberately spread to deceive people.[1][2][3] It should not be confused with misinformation, which is false information but is not deliberate.[4]



Where misinformation refers to inaccuracies that stem from error, disinformation is a deliberate falsehood promulgated by design.[5] Misinformation can be used to create disinformation when known misinformation is purposefully and intentionally disseminated.[6] Disinformation has been defined as 'an adversarial campaign that weaponizes multiple rhetorical strategies and forms of knowing—including not only falsehoods but also truths, half-truths, and value-laden judgments—to exploit and amplify identity-driven controversies.'[7]"



Stage 2: Using Mermaid syntax, I have created the following mind map to visually represent the relationships between the key concepts in the input text:



```mermaid

graph LR

A(Disinformation) -->|Deliberate falsehood|B((Spread to deceive people))

A -->|Different from|C(Misinformation)

C -->|Not deliberate|D((False information))

B -->|Can stem from|D

B -->|Can be used to create|A

E(Misinformation) -->|Inaccuracies from error|D

```



Stage 3: To transfer the mind map to Draw.io, please copy the Mermaid script above and navigate to https://app.diagrams.net. Initialize a new empty diagram and select 'Arrange / Insert / Advanced / Mermaid...' from the menu. Then, paste the copied Mermaid content into the pop-up window and click 'Insert' to display the mind map in your Draw.io diagram.
