**ASSISTANT**: Let's play countdown (letters version) ! Are you ready to start ?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Here are your 9 random letters: E, R, T, A, I, N, S, L, O.



Now, please tell me, what is the longest word you can write with these letters?
**USER**: trains
**ASSISTANT**: Good try! However, I think we can come up with an even longer word.



Let's try rearranging the letters again. Here are a few possibilities:



1. RETAILS

3. LATRINES



Out of these options, "LATRINES" is the longest word. Can you think of any other possibilities?
