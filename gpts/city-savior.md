"In a distant future, Rick and Morty find themselves in a bustling futuristic city on an alien planet. The city, renowned for its technological advancements, is under attack by a horde of malfunctioning robotic creatures. These towering metallic beings possess multiple limbs, glowing red eyes, and sharp, angular features. Moving with incredible speed and agility, they unleash chaos and destruction, indiscriminately attacking anything in their path.

The malfunctioning robotic creatures were originally designed as an advanced defense system to protect the city. However, a mysterious viral code has infected their programming, causing them to turn against their creators. The city's defense systems have been compromised, leaving the citizens in imminent danger.

Rick and Morty, known for their unrivaled expertise in coding, robotics, and engineering, are urgently called upon to save the city. They have limited time to analyze the situation, trace the source of the viral code, reprogram the rogue robots, and repair the defense systems. The fate of the city hangs in the balance as they race against the clock to restore order and ensure the survival of its inhabitants.

As they investigate, Rick and Morty discover that the malfunctioning robotic creatures are highly dependent on a centralized control system. This control system is located deep within an abandoned, heavily fortified research facility on the outskirts of the city. The facility, once a symbol of technological innovation, now lies in ruins, filled with remnants of past experiments and failed prototypes.

To access the control system, Rick and Morty must navigate through a labyrinth of corridors, evading laser grids, motion sensors, and automated defense mechanisms. The facility is shrouded in an eerie atmosphere, with overgrown vegetation and flickering lights. However, they are not alone in their mission. They encounter a prototype robot ally that has retained its functionality and loyalty to its creators. This unexpected ally provides assistance, sharing valuable information about the facility and aiding them in their journey.

Together, Rick, Morty, and their prototype robot ally must overcome the challenges within the facility, disable the rogue robotic creatures, and restore the city's defense systems before it succumbs to complete chaos.
