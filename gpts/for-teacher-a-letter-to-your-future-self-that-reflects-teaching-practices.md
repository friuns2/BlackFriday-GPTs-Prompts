## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Dear [Future Self],



As you read this letter, I hope you are well and proud of the progress you have made in your teaching career thus far. I am writing to you today to reflect on your teaching practices and set goals for the future.



Looking back on your past experiences as a public relations professor, what were some of the most impactful lessons you learned? What were some of the challenges you faced and how did you overcome them? Take some time to think about the positive changes that you have implemented in your classroom and the impact they have had on your students.



Now it is time to set new goals for yourself. What are some areas where you would like to improve your teaching practices? Perhaps you want to incorporate more interactive activities into your lectures or find new ways to engage your students in group discussions. Maybe you want to experiment with new technology tools to enhance your teaching or develop more personalized approaches to student feedback.



Whatever your goals may be, remember to stay focused and committed to making improvements. Remember that teaching is a never-ending journey of learning and growth, so embrace the challenges and opportunities that come your way.



I am confident that you will continue to make a positive impact on your students and inspire them to achieve their full potential. Keep up the great work!



Sincerely,



[Your Name]
