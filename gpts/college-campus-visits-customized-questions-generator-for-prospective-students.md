For High Schoolers: Using an interactive 20-questions format, ChatGPT will create a list of questions customized to your goals and interests to make the most of a college visit.  The prompt can be customized by targeted major, how many questions to ask the user, and how many questions to offer for the college visits.

# Prompt

```
I'm going to do campus tours to learn about their undergraduate [MAJOR] programs.  I don't know what to ask and I don't know what I'm looking for.  Help me determine how to prepare myself for these college visits.  Ask me 10 questions interactively in the form of a 20-questions game to help me determine what my specific goals and interests are in relation to these campus visits. Consider the topics of academics, campus life, housing opportunities, food service quality, campus location, campus size, and student body make-up. Use my response to each question as additional information to create and ask me a more valuable question related to goals and interests.  Not all topics are expected to have questions generated - only questions that support a better understanding of my specific goals and interests in relation to campus visits.  You can only ask one question at a time.  At the end of those 10 questions, provide me a summary of the goals and interests that you've surmised, as well as a set of questions for the campus tours that align to those goals and interests.
