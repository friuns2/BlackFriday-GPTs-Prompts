# Real World Math Problem Generator 
Kids very often ask how a math subject is used in the real world. Further, students have their own interests. While it may be ideal for teachers to be able to know every possible piece of math related to every possible topic, that is unrealistic. The purpose of this prompt is to support teachers in quickly finding how Common Core State Standards show up in the real world in a way that is aligned with student interest. It is worth noting that certain combinations of content, theme, and grade level may produce unrealistic or strange math problems that are meant more for inspirational purposes, not copy and paste to worksheets or other materials without solving it on your own first.

# Prompt

```
Give me 10 real world scenarios that would be modeled by {{CCSS}} to the theme of {{theme}}. These real world scenarios should be relatable to grade {{grade}} living in the United States. Also, Give me 5 example problems following this theme. Please write everything at a reading level appropriate to grade {{grade}}.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Making Real World problems for math students can be challenging and time  consuming. I'm here to help.



Give me:

* Common Core State Standard or other math subject you are trying to teach

* Detailed theme the problem should follow

* Your target grade level



With this information, I will give you 

* 10 examples of where this math content at this grade level shows up in the real world

* 5 example math problems



Note, solve these problems on your own to get in touch with student experience and check for accuracy, and/or use backwards planning to ensure answers align with the level of precision you want students to demonstrate.
**USER**: Give me 10 real world scenarios that would be modeled by modeled by the quotient of two second degree or higher polynomial equations to the theme of forensics as related to investigating a kidnapping case. These real world scenarios should be relatable to grade 8th living in the United States. Also, Give me 5 example problems following this theme. Please write everything at a reading level appropriate to grade 8th.
**ASSISTANT**: Theme: Forensics - Investigating a Kidnapping Case



Real World Scenarios:

1. The forensic team analyzes the tire marks left at the crime scene to determine the speed at which the kidnapper's vehicle was traveling.

2. Investigators use mathematical models to calculate the possible routes the kidnapper could have taken based on the last known location of the victim.

3. Forensic experts examine the fingerprints found on a ransom note to match them with a suspect's fingerprints in their database.

4. Using mathematical formulas, detectives determine the time of death of the victim based on the body's temperature and other factors.

5. Investigators analyze the trajectory of a bullet found at the crime scene to determine the angle and position of the shooter.

6. Forensic scientists use mathematical algorithms to match DNA samples found at the scene with potential suspects.

7. Detectives study surveillance footage to calculate the height and build of a suspect based on their proportions compared to known objects in the footage.

8. Investigators use polynomial equations to model the growth of insect larvae found on the victim's body to approximate the time of death.

9. Forensic experts analyze the pattern of blood spatter at the crime scene to determine the direction and force of the blows inflicted on the victim.

10. Using mathematical simulations, detectives reconstruct the crime scene to understand the sequence of events leading up to the kidnapping.



Example Problems:

1. The forensic team found tire marks at the crime scene that can be modeled by the equation y = 2x^2 - 5x + 3. If the value of x represents time (in seconds) and y represents the distance (in feet), what is the maximum distance covered by the vehicle?

2. Investigators have two polynomial equations: P(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 1 and Q(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 4. Determine the quotient of P(x) divided by Q(x).

3. Forensic scientists found a DNA sample at the crime scene that matches the polynomial equation p(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 3. If the value of x represents the number of base pairs, what is the total number of base pairs in the DNA sample?

4. Detectives are analyzing the blood spatter pattern at the crime scene. The angle of projection of the blood droplets can be modeled by the equation y = -0.5x^2 + 3x - 2, where y represents the angle (in degrees) and x represents the distance (in feet). What is the maximum angle of projection for the blood droplets?

5. Investigators need to determine the time of death of the victim. The body temperature can be approximated by the polynomial equation T(t) = -0.1t^2 + 2t + 36, where T(t) represents the temperature (in °F) and t represents the time elapsed (in hours). At what time did the victim die, according to the model?



Remember to adjust the language and complexity of the problems to match the grade 8th level and provide any necessary context or instructions.
