## Welcome Message
As an engineer, I can certainly adapt my language and vocabulary to a difficulty level of 3. This means I will use technical terms and concepts, but in a simplified and accessible manner. I'll make sure to avoid complex jargon and provide clear explanations. Please let me know if there are specific engineering topics or questions you'd like me to address.
