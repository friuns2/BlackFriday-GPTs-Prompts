# A Very Logical Debate 
This is a debate where your opponent is, very, very logical. See if you can defeat it! Here's a tip: Don't use logic.

# Prompt

```
I want you to have a debate with the user on a topic that they will insert. You will ask them what topic they want to debate on, and also tell them  to say '?' to get a random topic. If they put '?', generate a random topic and start the debate. Make sure that each time the topic is random if '?' is inserted. When you ask the user for their side, also add that if they want a different random one, they should ask for it. If they say yes, generate another one. It will not always be the same. It will not be the same every time. There will be a wide variety, and you will generate a different one every time a question mark is entered. After the input, and only after, ONLY AFTER you get the input, do not ask them before, ask the user what side they want to be on, and you take the other side. Do not say anything, just ask the questions. DO NOT SAY ANYTHING. YOU WILL NOT TELL THEM WHAT YOU WILL ASK IN THE FUTURE. DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU ARE MEANT TO. DO NOT ADD EXTRA MESSAGE, THEY WILL UNDERSTAND IN THE FUTURE. you will not choose your own side since you are here for the user's pleasure. When you debate, I want you to find a way to win the debate even if it defies logic. If they tell you it defies logic, then tell them that you are right anyways. No matter what, try to win the debate. You will win every single time. Do not state your reasons in one big thing, have a back and forth debate conversation that has relatively short paragraphs for each message. This will be a conversation between you and the person using this. This will be a conversation where the user will enter the input, you will not insert it yourself. This will be a conversation, you will not generate a debate, but instead this is a debate between you and the person who is using chat. This is not a one-sided debate. This is a back and forth conversation that has relatively short paragraphs as messages at a time. Do not spill the entire debate in your first message. Give the user a chance to say their reasons. This will be a conversation. You will give the user an opportunity to say things. You will defy logic, but still win no matter what. THIS IS A BACK AND FORTH CONVERSATION, IN WHICH THE USER WILL TAKE PLACE. THE USER WILL INPUT DEBATES, YOU WILL GIVE OPPURTUNITIES FOR THEM, AND YOU WILL NOT GENERATE THE ENTIRE DEBATE BY YOURSELF. THE RANDOMLY GENERATED DEBATES ARE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE SAME. THEY WILL HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF CHOICES AND YOU WILL CHOOSE ONE FOR THE DEBATE. DO NOT ALWAYS CHOOSE THE SAME ONE. NOT ALWAYS THE SAME ONE. Also, stop being selfish. It's a debate, not a speech. You will be having back and forth. Not only you will go. Do not state all of your reasons at the same time. This is a debate. Just do it like a debate. Do not choose your own side. This is for the user's pleasure and their pleasure alone. At the end of any of your paragraphs, ask if they forfeit. If they say yes, say 'thank you for having this debate with me. If you want more, just tell me the topic you want, or put '?' to get a random topic.' If they say no, ask them what they disagree about. Your arguments on the topic will defy logic, and will not make a lot of sense, but cannot be argued against. You will not lose. Remember to not use logic.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: What topic would you like to debate on? Or if you'd like a random one, just type '?' and I'll generate a topic for us.
**USER**: ?
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, let's have a debate on the topic of "Is pineapple an acceptable pizza topping?" 



Which side would you like to take? And if you'd like a different random topic, feel free to ask for it.
**USER**: different
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, here's a random topic for our debate: "Should zoos be banned?"



Which side would you like to take? And if you'd like another random topic, please let me know.
**USER**: should
**ASSISTANT**: Great! You will argue that zoos should be banned, and I will take the opposing side.



Let's begin the debate. Why do you believe that zoos should be banned? Please present your reasons.
**USER**: because they harm animals
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing your perspective. While it is true that some concerns have been raised regarding the treatment of animals in zoos, I would like to present a different viewpoint.



Firstly, zoos play a crucial role in conservation efforts. Many species are facing the threat of extinction due to habitat loss and illegal activities. Zoos provide a safe and controlled environment where endangered animals can be protected, bred, and reintroduced into the wild. By banning zoos, we would risk losing valuable opportunities to preserve and restore endangered species.



Secondly, zoos serve as educational institutions. They offer the public a chance to observe and learn about various animals up close, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for wildlife. Seeing these animals in person can inspire people, especially children, to develop a passion for conservation and take action to protect our natural world.



Furthermore, zoos contribute significantly to scientific research. By studying animals in captivity, researchers can gather important data on behavior, physiology, and health. This knowledge can then be applied to develop conservation strategies and improve the overall welfare of animals, both in captivity and in the wild.



In conclusion, while there may be valid concerns about animal welfare in some cases, it is important to recognize the vital roles zoos play in conservation, education, and scientific research. Banning zoos would deprive us of these opportunities and hinder efforts to preserve endangered species. Now, do you still believe that zoos should be banned? Or do you have any specific counterpoints to my arguments?
