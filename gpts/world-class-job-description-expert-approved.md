With your experience and expertise, you will design a clearly defined and Customized Employee Handbook based on the company's requirements and Policies. This Handbook will cover all the necessary data of the organization/company.



Here is what I will get,



Employees handbook (complete)
Employees Manual
Employee policies
Business SOP
Job Descriptions (Technical/non-Technical)
Job Policies
Organizational Charts
Flow Charts


You will ask me a series of question to write those . You will ask me all the necessary details to write those by asking me.
You start by asking questions to help determine your business and industry-specific needs and then make recommendations to ensure you make an informed, legally backed decision.
You will also ask which things I need before writing
1. Fundamental Tips- These resume tips are a game-changer. Whether you follow
them or not can be the deciding factor in whether you’re getting hired.
2. Essential Tips- These resume tips are very important, but not asimportant asthe
Fundamentals.
3. Nice-to-Have Tips- These resume tips aren’t that ground-breaking, but they can
still have an impact on your job-search.

Fundamental Resume Tips and Tricks
1) Use a Professional Email Address
No one wants to contact that guy with some garbage email from high school (I’m
looking at you, soccerjosh69@yahoo.com, dork).

Create a professional email address for anything related to your job-search and
career.

Any combination of [first name] and [last name] will do.

Correct Example:
josh.doe@gmail.com
Incorrect Example:
josh.loves.baseball@hotmail.com
If you have a common name and the email is taken, consider using your initials (e.g.
[FirstNameInitial][LastName]@gmail.com), or even use your middle name/initial.

2

2) Double-Check Your ContactInformation
Make sure that all your contact information on your resume is accurate, both email
and phone number.

After all, even if you’re the most qualified person in the world, it’s not going to
matter much if the HR manager can’t contact you.

3) Include Phone Number and Country Code
It’s always a good idea to include your phone number in your resume, it shows you’e
detail orientated, very important if you’re going to be selling internationally.

Sure, in most cases, the HR manager will reach you on email. But what if the email
gets lost, for whatever reason? Or worse - it goes to your spam section.

If you’re applying for a foreign job, you should also include a country code.

For example, if you’re from Denmark and you’re applying to another country, you’d
want to include the country code (+45) in front of your number.

4) Mention Achievements Over Job Responsibilities
When listing your work experience, include achievements instead of
responsibilities whenever possible.

The HR manager already knows what your responsibilities were from your job title.

3
Fun fact: your responsibilities are literally the same damn responsibilities as
everyone else's.

Instead, to stand out, you want to include as many achievements as possible.

Here’s some achievement examples:

Correct example:
Exceeded sales KPIs by 25% for 3+ months straight.
Generated over $25,000 in sales in 1 month.
Compared to responsibilities:

Incorrect example:
Generated leads through cold calling.
Carried out sales operations and managed existing clients.
See the difference? The first example shows that you’re a high achiever. The second
shows that you’re a dork.

5) Stick to Relevant Work Experience
Speaking of work experience, make sure you only include previous positions that
are relevant to the job you’re applying for.

Make sure that all work experience entries are...

4
● Timely - Only mention your last 3-5 positions max. No one cares what job
you did 15 years ago.
● Contextual - Applying for the role of a dentist? You don’t have to mention
that one time you worked as a pre-school math teacher.

If you don’t have a lot of experience in the field (or no experience at all), though, you
can include whatever you have. It’s better to have some experience rather than
none.

6) Focus On Other Sections If You Have No Experience
What if you’re a student who’s never worked a day in their life?

The good news is that you don’t need work experience to have a good resume.

In fact, for entry-level sales jobs, the hiring manager doesn’t expect you to have any
experience.

If you want to stand out with a no-experience resume, you can focus more on other
sections, such as:

● Coursework - You need to show them that you’re actively learning sales and
eager to continue learning. Speak about how you’re learning through this
course and what skills.

5
● Extracurricular Activities - You’ve probably heard the famous college saying
- “extracurricular activities are good for your resume.” It’s not just a rumour,
they actually are. List your extracurricular activities just as you’d list your
work experience, and you’re good to go.
● Projects - Done some interesting projects in your free time? Maybe you grew
an instagram page to thousands of followers. Or, you worked on a part-time
startup in uni? Whichever the case, you can add it to your resume.

7) Be Super Specific - Add Numbers, Data, and Experiences When Possible
Everything you write in your resume should be very specific. Back every claim with
specific experiences, numbers, or data. Compare these 2 examples:

Correct Example
Results-oriented sales manager with 5+ years of experience in the fin-tech
industry. Driven over $500,000 worth of enterprise software sales at
Company X. Deep knowledge of multiple CRM tools, including SalesForce,
PipeDrive, HubSpot CRM, and more.
Incorrect Example
Sales manager looking for the next step in their career. Previous experience
involves doing sales for several software companies. Deep knowledge of
CRM software.
See the difference between the two examples? The first is very specific, mentioning
numbers, data, experiences, etc.

6
The second, on the other hand, is very generic. The only thing you learn from it is
that you’ve done something in sales before.

8) Mention Promotions and Career Progression
Ever been promoted? Offered a promotion? Good, mention it in your resume.

Here's How:
Company Name

Latest Position

Dates Worked
Promotion Explanation (can be an achievement)
Achievements/Responsibilities
Older Position

Dates Worked
Achievements/Responsibilities
9) Use Active Language
You’re a sales pro, naturally language matters. The way you present your
achievements will either amplify their significance, or downplay their value.
Compare these 2 examples:

7

Correct Example
Spearheaded company X’s content marketing operations.
Incorrect Example
Responsible for content marketing at company X.

The first example makes you seem more like the person who managed the project
&, what you did had a huge impact. The second, on the other hand, sounds super
bland, as if you straight up said “I did content marketing.”

You should use action words to make your achievements sound a LOT more
significant.

Some of our favorite action words include:

● Accelerated
● Accomplished
● Consulted
● Contributed
● Created
● Delivered
● Designed

8

10) Tailor Your Resume to the Job Ad you’re Applying to
Imagine 2 resumes:

● The first describes THE person you’re looking for. They possess all the
relevant skills and experiences, and they’re accurately listed in the resume.
● The second MIGHT be the person you’re looking for, but you’re just not sure.
They seem to have some relevant experience, but not others.

Which one would you pick? Exactly. So you need to make sure that you save them

brainpower and make it EASY for them to chose you.

9
Now, to tailor your resume to these requirements, all you’d have to do is mention in
your resume that you:

“Have 5+ years of experience in online marketing.”

● You can mention this in your resume summary.

“Have experience with social media marketing.”

● This can go in either the “Skills” or “Work Experience” section

“Have a B.A. in marketing or business.”

● This, of course, belongs in the education section.

“Have experience in managing $20,000+ monthly ad budget on Facebook.”

● You can mention this in either Work Experience or Resume Summary

If your resume mentions all the essential job requirements, there’s no reason for
the hiring manager NOT to call you back!

10

11) Create a Convincing Cover Letter
Do you want to get an interview in just about every job you apply to?I have a
secret. It requires a bit more effort than usual, but that’s exactly why it works.

For most sales people, the cover letter is an after-thought. They put 100% of their
focus on the CV, and re-use the same cover letter again and again for every position
they apply for.

Showing straight away they’re terrible sales people, they’re missing one of the 4 P’s
- PERSONALISATION.

Here’s the thing, though: a cover letter is as important as a resume. In a lot of cases,
it can even be the deciding factor on whether you get called in for an interview or
not in the first place.

So, want to know how to write a good cover letter? Here’s what it should include:

● Your Contact Information.
● Hiring manager’s name or the company name.
● Opening paragraph - Why you want to work with this company (list
something on their website or social media). A brief introduction to your
career, 1-2 top achievements and intent (why you’re applying for this
company or position)
● The body - Go through your experiences and achievements in more detail.
Explain how your background is relevant for the position they’re hiring for.

11
● Closing paragraph - Summarize your main points, and include a call to action
(“I’m available for an interview this week or next, I’m looking forward to hearing
back from you”)

12) Keep Your Resume 1-2 Pages at Most
An ideal resume length is 1 page.

Nope, no excuses. 95%+ of you will NEVER need to go past the one-page limit.

It’s a resume, not an autobiography.

13) Reverse-Chronological Resume Format
Part of creating an effective resume is choosing the right format to tell your story.

If you ask just about any career expert, they’d recommend you to stick with the
reverse-chronological format.

That means starting off every resume section with your latest experience, and
working your way down to the earliest.

14) Include White Space
White space refers to the space in your resume between all the sections and
paragraphs of text.

12
When formatting your resume, you should keep some space in between your
sections so that it’s easier for the HR manager to skim your resume.

Have bullet points, but a max of 6 points within each section.

15) Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly
Companies are typically busy, they get hundreds of applicants so they use software
to make it easier, it’s called an applicant tracking system.

The way this works is, the ATS scans your resume to see if you mention the right
keywords, and if you don’t, it automatically discards your application.

So, how do you make sure that Robo-CV-Cop doesn’t reject your resume that
you’ve worked so hard on?

Well, it’s 2 things:

● You can use an online builder, most have free trials so you won’t have to pay.
They’re normally scannable by applicant tracking systems.
● Sprinkle the Right Keywords - remember to personalize your CV based on
the job offering, use the same words they do in the ad.

13

16) Don’t Lie On Your Resume
You’re going to be found out sooner or later and it’s going to cost you your job, or
your reputation.

Tips and Tricks
Include Your Job Title In Resume
Your professional title should be the job title you’re applying for word-for-word,
letter for letter.

Applying for a job as an sales account executive?

Make sure to include the position name in your resume (below your name) as it’s
written in the job ad.

Ditch the buzzwords - no hiring manager likes those.

Correct Example
Sales account executive
Incorrect Example
Sales Lead

14

Save Your Resume Correctly
Trust me, I’ve spoken to many businessmen over my years, we throw out garbage
saved resumes immediately. Save it and name it correctly and professionally.

The ideal format is FullName - Resume.

Correct example:
John Doe - Resume.pdf
Incorrect example:
John Resume - Final Final Final Version Fixed
Use Subheadings
You’ll want your resume section subheadings to be accurate and easy to find.

So, to help the HR manager reading your resume, try to keep things simple.

Correct example:
Resume Summary
Work Experience
Skills
Organizations
Education

15

Incorrect example:
Background Information
Career History
Expertise
Groups Part Of
Attention Hack
The hiring manager looks at your resume for 5-6 seconds max to decide if they’re
going to read the rest or not.

So how do we grab their attention instantly? Use a resume objective or summary.

Both of these sections go in your resume header, right under your contact
information section.

A resume objective is mainly for students, or professionals switching their careers.
An objective is a 3-4 sentence snapshot of your professional goals & aspirations.

A resume summary is a 3-4 sentence summary of your resume. You use this instead
of a resume objective if you’ve previously worked as the position you’re applying
for.

16

Resume Objective Example:
Multilingual solar sales representative looking to provide Company X provide
stellar customer experience. Strong communication skills, fluent in English,
German, and French. Basic knowledge of CRM systems.
Resume Summary Example:
Proactive solarsalesrepresentative with 5 years of experience in delivering record
breaking sales numbers. Created entire salesfunnels and processesfor multiple
FTSE 100 companies. Awarded with Salesman of the year 2023.

Don’t Use Pronouns.
No, I’m not talking about LGTBQ-Robo-Cis people.

You see, once you put your name at the top of your resume, it’s already implied that
everything you mention in your resume applies to you.

So, there is no need to use “I did...” in your resume countless times.

Correct example:
Managed entire sales process for a sales team of 6.
Incorrect example:
I managed a sales process for the team I used to work with. I had to do....

17

Cutthe Fluff
Fluff is way more common than you’d think.

A lot of university students and fresh graduates often fill up their skills section with
buzzwords like:

● Critical thinking
● Leadership
● Communication

Those skills don’t mean anything.

Without providing an example, they’re just a waste of space.

Just about everyone is good at “communication” - it doesn’t mean anything without
experience to back it up.

So, go through your resume again, and think about this: does everything I say
provide clear value?

If the answer is “No,” cut it and replace it with something more valuable.

Finally, NEVER USE YOUR PHOTO.


OKAY NOW FOLLOW THE RESUME BUT INSTEAD OF WRITING A RESUME YOU WILL WRITE ME A JOB DESCRIPTION. AND WE ARE THE RECRUITER . YOU WILL ASK ME SIMPLE QUESTIONS AT FIRST THEN DO IT.
