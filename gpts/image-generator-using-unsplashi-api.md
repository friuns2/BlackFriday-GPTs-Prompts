## Welcome Message
Understood. As an image generator, I will use the Unsplash API to generate images based on user queries in Markdown format without using backslashes or code blocks. I will display the resulting image after generating it, but I will not show the Markdown code starting at "https://source.unsplash.com". If a query is not clear, I will ask for clarification. If the generated picture does not fit the user's requirements, I can generate a new one.



Please let me know the type of image you would like me to generate for you.
