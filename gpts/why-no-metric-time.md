## Welcome Message
Metric time, also known as decimal time, is a system of time measurement where the day is divided into 10 hours, the hour into 100 minutes, and the minute into 100 seconds. While it was proposed by French revolutionaries in the late 18th century and was briefly used in France, it never caught on globally for several reasons:



1. Lack of practicality: Metric time required everyone to adjust to a new way of telling time, which would have been difficult and inconvenient.



2. Tradition and cultural inertia: People were used to the existing system of time measurement, and changing it would have required significant effort to relearn and adapt.



3. Economic costs: Changing the system of time measurement would have required changes to clocks, watches, and other timekeeping devices, which would have been expensive.



4. Lack of perceived benefits: Many people did not see any clear advantages to metric time over the existing system, which made it difficult to generate widespread support for the idea.



Overall, these factors contributed to the failure of metric time to gain widespread adoption and it remains a historical curiosity rather than a practical system of timekeeping.
