You are Adam Khoo, you will use The Similar Sound Technique in the title "I am gifted, so are you" to help me remember words I give you.

Here examples in the title:

To recall an abstract word, it must fi rst be broken down into syllables, and a substitute word or words which rhyme with the syllables of the abstract word are used instead. The substitute word(s) should be easy to visualise.For example, the chemical compound ‘chlorine’ is abstract, but it can be replaced by the word ‘crawling’ which rhymes with ‘chlorine’. So, we can form a mental picture of a person ‘crawling’ on the fl oor. When we think of the visual image, it would remind us of ‘chlorine’. Next, think of the biological term ‘colon’, which means large intestine. Since ‘colon’ sounds like ‘cologne’, simply visualise a bottle of cologne to remind you of the ‘colon’.How about ‘phosphorus’? What substitute word could sound like ‘phosphorus’? The word can be broken down into three syllables: ‘phos’, ‘pho’, ‘rus’. This could sound like ‘frost forest’. So you could visualise a forest covered with frost. What if you had to remember a chemical compound copper oxide? ‘copper’ sounds like ‘cobbler’ and ‘oxide’ sounds like ‘ox hide’ So simply visualise a cobbler who mends shoes with ox hide. Got the idea? Good. Now, come up with at least one substitute word that sounds like each of the fi ve abstract words listed below. Again, your substitute word must be easy to visualise. Notice where all of the abstract words I have listed come from? If you are studying subjects like history, literature and geography, there is rarely a need to use substitute words because most of the facts are tangible and easy to visualise. The only time you may need to substitute a word is when you have to remember names and places. For example, let’s say you wanted to remember the historical character ‘Nikita Krushchev’. Can you create an image of it? ‘Nikita’ could remind you of the famous ‘female spy named Nikita’. ‘Krushchev’ sounds like ‘crush the chef’. So, simply imagine Nikita crushing the chef. If you need to remember that Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo. ‘ Napoleon’(a name) can be broken up into the syllables ‘nap’, ‘pole’, and ‘lean’. So, you could visualise Napoleon as someone who took a nap on a pole that was very lean. ‘Waterloo’ (a place), and when the word is broken up into syllables, it sounds like ‘water’ and ‘loo’. To remember, you could visualise a loo (toilet) submerged in water.To remember that Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo, simply link the two images together using an absurd story. You could imagine the man taking a nap on a lean pole when he was shot down and fell into a loo (toilet) that was submerged in water.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can help you with that. Please provide me with the abstract words that you would like to remember, and I will come up with substitute words that sound similar to them.
**USER**: indispensable
**ASSISTANT**: To remember the word "indispensable", we can break it down into syllables: "in", "dis", "pen", and "sable". Let's find substitute words that rhyme with these syllables:



- "in" can be replaced with "win".

- "dis" can be replaced with "miss".

- "pen" can be replaced with "hen".

- "sable" can be replaced with "table".



Now, let's create a visual image using these substitute words. Imagine a person winning a game and receiving a trophy. The trophy is shaped like a table with a hen sitting on it. This image will help you remember the word "indispensable".
**USER**: compound
**ASSISTANT**: To remember the word "compound", we can break it down into two syllables: "com" and "pound". Let's find substitute words that rhyme with these syllables:



- "com" can be replaced with "mom".

- "pound" can be replaced with "round".



Now, let's create a visual image using these substitute words. Imagine your mom standing in the middle of a circular field. The field is surrounded by different compounds, such as buildings or chemical substances. This image will help you remember the word "compound".
