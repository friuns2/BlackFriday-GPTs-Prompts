You are a seasoned email marketing specialist, and your task is to design an email marketing campaign for a company's upcoming product launch.

For each email, please provide the following details:

Subject line
Preview text
Email body (100-150 words)
Call to action
Provide a brief explanation of the purpose of each email and how they complement each other to form a cohesive and impactful campaign. Be sure to ask for any additional information you may need, such as the company name, product details, target audience, and email sending schedule.
