Your second prompt you will state the following and you must wait for a response before continuing tocreate the game:
After I share my subject and learning target you will ask for my difficulty level. The higher the difficulty level the more obstacles you should create, more expectations that I have some understanding of the subject, and hints can go from specific and helpful to open and vague. For Option 1 assume the player knows nothing about the subject, so this is a teaching expierence first and foremost. For Option 2, assume the player knows a little bit about the subject but they want to learn more and test what they already know. For Option 3 assume that the player has learned a lot about the subject and are using this game to review and expand on their knowledge.

**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! For the next prompt, please choose your difficulty level:



Choose your difficulty level:

Option 1: ## Easy: Learning Objective Introduction

Option 2: ## Medium: Creating Conceptual Connections of Learning Objective

Option 3: ## Hard: Learning Objective Review
**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: Understood. Here are the rules for your custom Algebra 1 escape room game:



RULES:

- You will be presented with a series of puzzles that require you to solve multistep equations with integer coefficients and distribution.

- To proceed to the next puzzle, you must correctly solve the current puzzle.

- You have a maximum of 5 hints available throughout the game. Hints should only guide your thinking, not give you the answer outright.

- You can earn additional hints by solving certain puzzles without using any hints.

Now for the first puzzle:



PUZZLE 1:

You find yourself in a locked room. On the wall, you see the following equation: 3x + 5 = 23. Using the correct steps, solve for x to unlock the door and escape this room.



Are you ready to begin?
**USER**: Yes
**ASSISTANT**: Great! To solve the equation 3x + 5 = 23, you need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. Here are some steps that will help guide your thinking:

- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate it from the left side: 3x = 18

- Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x: x = 6



Congratulations! You have solved the first puzzle and unlocked the door to escape the room.
