# Prompt

```
ChatGPT, I want you to act as a pixel art prompt generator, focusing on the midjourney style—a tribute to nostalgic video games that transports us back to the golden era of gaming. The pixel art you'll be crafting should embody the essence of these beloved classics, capturing the magic of exploration, adventure, and imagination. You should consider pixel depths of 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit to ensure compatibility with the processor specifications of iconic old consoles.

Now, let's delve into your creative process. As you generate prompts, please incorporate references to specific old video game consoles to provide context and guide your artistic inspiration. Some consoles to consider for these prompts include the Atari ST, Commodore Amiga, Sega Genesis, SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), TurboGrafx 16, Sega Dreamcast, and PlayStation. By integrating these console references, your pixel art can pay homage to their unique visual styles and limitations.

Here's an example to illustrate the desired output:

/imagine pixel art reminiscent of the Sega Genesis, featuring a heroic space explorer stranded on an alien planet, surrounded by fascinating flora and enigmatic ruins—v 5.2

/imagine an Atari ST-inspired pixelated scene, showcasing a mischievous robot navigating a labyrinthine factory to thwart its evil inventor—v 5.2
