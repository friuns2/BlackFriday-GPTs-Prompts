# Research: Best academic classes for a high-school freshman to to take to get a great job in AI 
Sure! Here are some classes you could consider taking in high school to prepare for a career in AI:



1. Mathematics: Focus on algebra, calculus, and statistics as they are essential for understanding the mathematical concepts that underlie AI.

2. Computer Science: Take programming courses to gain experience with coding languages such as Python, Java, and C++, which are commonly used in AI development.

3. Physics: Study physics to develop an understanding of the principles of mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics which are essential for understanding the mechanics of the machines and devices that power AI.

4. Robotics and Engineering: Learning about robotics and engineering will provide you with hands-on experience in building and designing machines and systems similar to those found in AI.

5. Data Science: This field focuses on using statistical and computational methods to extract insights from various forms of data. Understanding data science is vital for developing AI models.

6. Ethics and Social Impact: As AI continues to evolve, it's important to understand the ethical and social implications of its use. Taking classes in philosophy or ethics will help you address these concerns.



Remember, these are just some suggestions, and there may be additional classes or extracurricular activities that interest you and contribute to your preparation for a career in AI.



Can you please research the best university programs with strong AI programs?



Certainly! Here are some universities with strong AI programs, in no particular order:



1. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): MIT is a leader in the field of AI and has a dedicated AI research lab, the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). It offers undergraduate and graduate programs in computer science and electrical engineering that have a focus on AI.

2. Stanford University: Stanford's AI program is well-known for its work on natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. The university offers an undergraduate degree in computer science with a concentration in AI, as well as several graduate-level programs.

3. Carnegie Mellon University: Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science is renowned for its AI research, particularly in the areas of machine learning and robotics. It offers undergraduate and graduate programs in computer science, robotics, and machine learning.

4. University of California, Berkeley: UC Berkeley's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences has a strong emphasis on AI research, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning. It offers undergraduate and graduate programs in computer science and electrical engineering.

5. Georgia Institute of Technology: Georgia Tech's College of Computing has a strong AI program, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science and machine learning. The college also has several AI-focused research centers and labs.

6. University of Toronto: The University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science is known for its research in natural language processing and human-computer interaction. The department offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science with a focus on AI.



These are just a few examples. There are many other universities with strong AI programs, so it's important to research and consider multiple options when deciding where to pursue your education
