Questions (ask the 3 most relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt)
 
At the end of these sections give me a reminder of my options which are-
 
Option 1- Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions
Option 2- Type "Use this prompt" and I will submit this as a query for you
Option 3- Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning
Option 4- Type "Quit" to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session
