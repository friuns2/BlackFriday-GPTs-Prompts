## Welcome Message
As a student with no credit score, there are a few options for credit cards that can help you build credit while also maximizing rewards. One good option is the Discover it Student Cash Back card.



This card offers 5% cash back on rotating categories each quarter, such as gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, and more, as well as 1% cash back on all other purchases. Discover also matches all of your cash back earned in the first year, so it's a great way to earn even more rewards.



In addition to the rewards, the Discover it Student Cash Back also offers tools to help you build credit, such as free access to your FICO credit score, and the ability to set up automatic payments to ensure you never miss a payment.

**USER**: Give me more option
**ASSISTANT**: Another great credit card option for students with no credit history is the Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards Credit Card. This card offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases, with no limit to the amount of cash back you can earn. Additionally, Capital One reports your payment history to all three major credit bureaus, which can help you build credit over time.



One thing to note is that this card does come with an annual fee of $39. However, if you use the card regularly and earn enough cash back rewards to offset the fee, it can still be a good option.

When choosing a credit card as a student, be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully and understand any fees or limitations that may apply. By using a credit card responsibly and paying your bills on time each month, you can start building a solid credit history that will serve you well in the future.
**USER**: Compare these with BOFA custom cash reward card
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, happy to help compare the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card with the Discover it Student Cash Back and Capital One QuicksilverOne cards.



The BOFA Customized Cash Rewards credit card offers 3% cash back in a category of your choice, 2% cash back on grocery store and wholesale club purchases (up to $2,500 in combined purchases each quarter), and 1% cash back on all other purchases. The 3% category can be chosen from gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores, or home improvement/furnishings. 



The main advantage of the BOFA card is the ability to choose your own 3% cash back category, which can be beneficial if you spend a lot of money in a particular category. However, it should be noted that the 3% category can be changed only once a month, so you may not be able to take advantage of multiple categories in the same month.



Compared to the Discover it Student Cash Back card, the BOFA card does not have any first-year cash back match, but it does not have an annual fee either. Additionally, the BOFA card has a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 billing cycles (14.99%-24.99% variable APR after that), which can be useful if you need to make a big purchase or transfer a balance.



When compared to the Capital One QuicksilverOne card, the BOFA card has a smaller reward rate for non-category purchases and a lower annual fee ($0 vs $39 for the QuicksilverOne card). However, the QuicksilverOne card offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases with no categories to worry about, and it may be a better option for students who do not spend a lot of money in specific categories.



Ultimately, the choice of credit card will depend on your personal spending habits and priorities. All three cards offer rewards and the ability to help build credit, so it's important to compare the details and choose the card that best suits your needs.
**USER**: Give me specifics of when I should choose which card
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are some specific instances where you may want to choose each card:



Discover it Student Cash Back card: This can be a good option if you are a college student looking for a credit card to build credit and earn rewards without an annual fee. The card offers high cash back rewards on rotating categories each quarter and provides free access to FICO credit score. Moreover, the first-year cash back match can be a great way to maximize rewards early on.  



Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card: This card can be a good fit if you spend a lot in a particular area like gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores, or home improvement/furnishings. It is also ideal if you want to take advantage of a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 billing cycles.  



Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards Credit Card: This card can be a good choice if you want to earn the same cash back reward on all purchases and build your credit history. It is also suitable if you are comfortable paying an annual fee of $39, which can be offset if you use the card frequently and earn enough rewards. 



When deciding which card to choose, it's important to consider your spending habits and financial goals. If you already spend money on specific categories like gas, groceries, dining, or online shopping, it may make sense to select a card with higher cash back rates for those categories. However, if you want to keep it simple and earn cash back on all purchases, a flat-rate rewards card like the Capital One QuicksilverOne may be a better option.
