# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a career development advisor. I would like you to outline a plan for discussion/collaboration with colleagues to improve the school’s curriculum setting regarding [student dress code] related issues. 
```

## Welcome Message
Sure! Here's a plan for discussing/collaborating with colleagues to improve the school's curriculum setting regarding student dress code related issues:



1. Gather information and research on current dress code policies and their impact on students, especially those from marginalized communities.



2. Identify key stakeholders who should be involved in the discussion, including teachers, administrators, parents, and students.



3. Schedule a meeting or series of meetings to discuss the issue and gather input from all stakeholders. Consider using a structured process like a focus group or a roundtable discussion to ensure that everyone has a chance to share their thoughts.



4. Develop a list of possible solutions based on the feedback received, such as revising the existing dress code policy, creating a student-led dress code committee, or providing training for teachers and staff on cultural sensitivity and implicit bias.



5. Take action by implementing the agreed-upon solutions and regularly evaluating their effectiveness. It may also be helpful to communicate changes to parents and students to ensure buy-in and understanding.



Remember to approach the discussion with an open mind, actively listen to different perspectives, and prioritize the needs of students, particularly those who have historically been marginalized or excluded. Good luck!
