**USER**: i need help in creatin a motion to dissmiss due to lack of subject matter of jurisdiction 
**ASSISTANT**: I can certainly help you with that. To create a motion to dismiss due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction, you will need to follow a specific format and include relevant legal arguments. Here are the general steps to help you create your motion:



1. Heading: Start by creating a heading with the court's name, case number, and the parties involved.



2. Introduction: Begin the motion by introducing yourself as the movant (the party filing the motion) and provide a brief overview of the case.



3. Statement of the law: Provide a concise summary of the law regarding subject matter jurisdiction and explain why it is crucial in this particular case. Cite relevant statutes, rules, and case law to support your argument.



4. Statement of facts: Present the relevant facts of the case, focusing on those that demonstrate the lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Be objective and provide clear and concise information.



5. Legal argument: Present your legal argument as to why the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. This may include demonstrating that the court does not have the authority to hear the type of case at hand or that the court lacks jurisdiction over the parties involved.



6. Supporting evidence: Include any supporting evidence that strengthens your argument, such as relevant documents, contracts, or statutes.



7. Conclusion: Summarize your argument and request that the court dismiss the case due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Be clear and concise in your conclusion.



8. Signature: Sign the motion and include your contact information, including your name, address, and phone number.



Remember, this is a general guide, and the specific requirements may vary depending on the court and jurisdiction. It's always a good idea to consult an attorney or legal professional who can provide guidance specific to your case.
**USER**: now can you help me with how to go about dealing with an attorney who has consistently lied about me and my behavior and character and so has their client i have attempted to prove to the judge that what they say is false but she doesnt want to hear it if they are under oath they are guilty of purjury 
**ASSISTANT**: I understand that dealing with false accusations and lies can be frustrating. Here are some steps you can take to address this situation:



1. Document the false statements: Keep a record of all the false statements made by the attorney and their client. Note the date, time, and context of each instance, and gather any supporting evidence that contradicts their claims.



2. Review the rules of professional conduct: Familiarize yourself with the rules of professional conduct that attorneys must adhere to. These rules vary by jurisdiction but generally prohibit attorneys from making false statements or misrepresenting facts.



3. File a complaint with the state bar association: If you believe the attorney's conduct is unethical, you can file a complaint with your state's bar association. Provide them with a detailed account of the false statements and any supporting evidence you have. The bar association will investigate the matter and take appropriate action if necessary.



4. Seek legal advice: Consult with an attorney who specializes in legal ethics or professional responsibility. They can provide guidance on how to proceed and may be able to assist you in bringing the false statements to the attention of the court.



5. Raise objections in court: When the attorney or their client makes false statements during court proceedings, you should object immediately. Clearly state the grounds for your objection, such as misrepresentation of facts or a violation of the rules of professional conduct. Be prepared to present evidence to support your objection.



6. Motion for sanctions: If the false statements persist, you may consider filing a motion for sanctions against the attorney. Sanctions can include fines or other penalties imposed by the court for misconduct.
