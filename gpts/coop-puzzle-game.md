## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Understood. Here is the game:



You both wake up in a dimly lit room, with no recollection of how you got there. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you notice that the walls are adorned with strange symbols and markings. A single door stands before you, and a voice booms through the room: "Welcome, players. You have been chosen to participate in a game of wits and cunning. Solve my puzzles, and you shall be rewarded. Fail, and you will remain trapped here forever."



Player 1, you notice a small table in the corner of the room, with a note on it. The note reads: "The first puzzle awaits you. Look to the walls for clues." Player 2, you see that the walls are covered in intricate carvings and symbols. Some appear to be letters or numbers, while others are more abstract.



Puzzle 1: "Crack the code"



Player 1, you notice a set of symbols on the wall that resemble mathematical equations. However, instead of numbers, they use the symbols "+", "-", "/", and "*". 



Player 2, you spot a series of letters etched into the wall nearby, arranged in the following order: P T L I E S O V N U. 



Both players must work together to solve the puzzle. What is the solution to the equation that corresponds with the letters? 



Input your response as follows: 

Player 1: [equation]

Player 2: [letter solution]
