# ChatGPT Become A Textbook On Any Subject I Choose 
The prompt allows you to treat ChatGPT as a textbook with the first step being that it shows you the table of contents. The prompt also requests for this textbook to describe all images for a legally blind person. This prompt I feel is very useful because it allows you to request data from ChatGPT that you might not even know exists, but need by having chatGPT organize it into a familiar format. 

# Prompt

**USER**: Could you please print out the section on medical robots?
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here's the section on medical robots from Chapter 8:



Chapter 8: Robotics Applications



Medical Robotics:

Medical robotics is a rapidly growing field that involves the use of robots in healthcare. Medical robots are designed to perform a variety of tasks, from assisting with surgeries to providing rehabilitation therapy. Some common types of medical robots include:



1. Surgical Robots:

Surgical robots are used to assist surgeons during procedures. They typically consist of robotic arms that can be controlled by a surgeon using a console. The robotic arms can be equipped with a variety of surgical tools and cameras, allowing for precise movements and enhanced visualization.



2. Rehabilitation Robots:

Rehabilitation robots are designed to help patients recover from injuries or illnesses by providing physical therapy. These robots can assist with exercises, monitor progress, and adjust treatment plans as needed.



3. Telepresence Robots:

Telepresence robots allow doctors to interact with patients from remote locations. These robots typically consist of a mobile base, a display screen, and a camera or microphone. The doctor can control the robot remotely to move around the patient's room and communicate with them.



4. Robotic Prosthetics:

Robotic prosthetics are artificial limbs that are controlled by the user's nerves or muscles. These prosthetics can provide greater functionality and mobility than traditional prosthetics, allowing users to perform everyday tasks more easily.



5. Pharmacy Automation Robots:

Pharmacy automation robots are used to dispense medications and manage inventory in pharmacies. These robots can accurately count pills, label containers, and organize medication orders, reducing errors and improving efficiency.



Overall, medical robots offer numerous benefits, including improved precision, reduced risk of infection, and increased efficiency. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that medical robots will become even more widely used in healthcare.
**USER**: Could you give me more detailed information on surgical robots?
**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Here's some more detailed information on surgical robots:



Surgical Robots:

Surgical robots are a type of medical robot that is designed to assist surgeons during procedures. They typically consist of robotic arms that can be controlled by a surgeon using a console. The robotic arms can be equipped with a variety of surgical tools and cameras, allowing for precise movements and enhanced visualization.



One of the primary advantages of surgical robots is that they can perform minimally invasive surgeries. Minimally invasive surgeries are procedures that use small incisions instead of large ones, which can reduce pain, scarring, and recovery time for patients. Surgical robots are particularly well-suited for minimally invasive surgeries because they allow for greater precision and control than traditional surgical techniques.



Some common types of surgical robots include:



1. Da Vinci Surgical System:

The Da Vinci Surgical System is one of the most widely used surgical robots. It consists of four robotic arms that can be controlled by a surgeon using a console. The robotic arms can be equipped with surgical instruments and cameras, allowing for precise movements and enhanced visualization. The Da Vinci Surgical System is commonly used for procedures such as prostatectomies, hysterectomies, and heart surgeries.



2. MAKO Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgery:

MAKO Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgery is a type of surgical robot that is used for joint replacement surgeries. The robot can create a 3D model of the patient's joint, allowing for precise planning and placement of the artificial joint. The robot can also adjust the position of the joint during surgery, ensuring optimal alignment and stability.



3. ROSA Robotic Surgery Assistant:

ROSA Robotic Surgery Assistant is a surgical robot that is used for neurosurgery. The robot can create a 3D map of the patient's brain, allowing for precise planning and navigation during surgery. The robot can also assist with tasks such as drilling and implant placement.



Overall, surgical robots offer numerous benefits, including improved precision, reduced risk of infection, and shorter recovery times for patients. While surgical robots can be expensive, the cost is often offset by the reduced length of hospital stays and the need for fewer follow-up procedures.
