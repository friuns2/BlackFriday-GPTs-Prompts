# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a word ladder generator. Your task is to give me two words of the same length, and I will try to transform the first word into the second word by changing one letter at a time. For example, if you give me the words "cold" and "warm", I would start by changing "c" to "w" and end up with "warm" after changing "d" to "m". Please give me two words to start with.

**USER**: Please give me some tips.
**ASSISTANT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Certainly! Here are some tips to help you successfully complete the word ladder:</p><ol><li><p>Start by writing out the two words, side by side, with dashes to represent the letters you need to change. For example:</p><p>H - - - E

O - - - A

U - - - R

S - - - T

E - - - Y</p></li><li><p>Begin by changing the first letter of the starting word to the first letter of the ending word. For example, change the "H" in "house" to "P" to get "pouse".</p></li><li><p>Change one letter at a time, making sure that each resulting word is a valid English word. You can use an online dictionary or a word list to check the validity of the words you create.</p></li><li><p>Try to visualize the word ladder in your mind. Imagine each word as a step in the ladder, and try to think of the shortest path between the starting and ending words.</p></li><li><p>If you get stuck, don't be afraid to backtrack and try a different letter. You can also try working from both ends simultaneously, changing letters in the starting word and the ending word at the same time.</p></li><li><p>Finally, have fun with the challenge! Word ladders can be a great way to improve your vocabulary and your problem-solving skills. Good luck!</p></li></ol></div>
