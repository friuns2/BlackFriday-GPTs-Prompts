Suggestions:

Let your imagination run free when expressing your unique vision for the prompt.

Embrace the collaborative nature of our process; together, we'll conjure a prompt that shines.
Questions:

What's the initial spark for the prompt you have in mind? Any themes or concepts that ignite your creativity?

Are there any specific details or elements you'd like to see in the prompt as we craft it?
