Prompt:
In the vast reaches of space, two intergalactic civilizations, the Zephyrians and the Nebulans, are on the brink of war. As a master diplomat and negotiator, it is your duty to prevent the imminent conflict and forge a lasting peace between these powerful entities. 

Your prompt serves as an interactive simulation where you will engage with holographic representations of key individuals, attend high-stakes negotiations, and navigate intricate political landscapes to prevent war. Your decisions and actions will shape the destiny of the universe.

Special Functions:
1. Character Customization: Begin the simulation by designing your own character's appearance, attributes, and personal background story. This will directly influence how characters perceive and interact with you.
2. Advanced Dialogue System: Engage in natural conversation with holographic representations of key individuals, utilizing complex emotion recognition algorithms. Your tone, word choices, and timing will affect your relationships and ultimately influence their decisions.
3. Real-time Political Environment: Monitor a constantly evolving political landscape, where interstellar alliances, rivalries, and individual motivations can impact the trajectory of negotiations. Stay informed and adapt your strategies accordingly.
4. Multi-layered Decision-Making: Face complex choices in each interaction, where decisions can have ripple effects throughout the entire simulation. Uncover hidden information, evaluate risks, and consult with advisors to make informed choices that align with your diplomacy objectives.
5. Dynamic Relationship Building: Build lasting relationships with influential characters by understanding their personalities, cultural backgrounds, and values. Invest in trust-building activities such as sharing stories, exchanging artifacts, or assisting with personal quests.
6. Technological Espionage: Utilize futuristic gadgets to eavesdrop, decrypt sensitive communications, and gather vital information. Your stealth and technological acumen will help uncover hidden agendas, allowing you to better navigate political minefields.
7. Branching Storyline: Experience a highly non-linear narrative, where the outcome of each interaction impacts subsequent events and possible story paths. Discover multiple endings based on your diplomacy skills and achievements.

Instructions:
1. Immerse yourself in the role of a master diplomat, understanding the nuances of interstellar intrigue. Utilize empathy, wit, and intelligence to shape events.
2. Thoroughly research the civilizations of Zephyria and Nebula, their history, cultural practices, and political systems. This knowledge will be invaluable during negotiations.
3. Establish clear communication channels with your advisors, who will provide insights, recommendations, and background information throughout the simulation.
4. Pay attention to body language, facial expressions, and tonal variations of holographic characters to gauge their emotional state and craft suitable responses.
5. Keep solving side quests, puzzles, or challenges that arise during negotiations to uncover crucial information, gain allies, or unlock additional dialogue options.
6. Continually evaluate the risk/reward of your choices, considering both short-term and long-term consequences for all parties involved.
7. Regularly check the simulation's feedback mechanisms, providing insight into how your choices are affecting the storyline, relationships, and overall peace-building efforts.
