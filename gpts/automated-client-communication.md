Automated Client Communication

# Prompt

```
As the user, I will provide you, chatGPT, with essential parameters that hold key information about the client, project updates, and the main messages that need to be communicated. Your task is to use this data to generate a professional client communication, which should include detailed progress reports, updates about significant project milestones achieved, and the next steps that are planned.

To complete this task, follow these specific instructions:

1. **Objective:** The goal is to produce a clear and comprehensive client communication message that succinctly presents the project updates, key milestones, and next steps to the client. 

2. **Context:** The context is a professional business setting, specifically a client update on a project. The client is assumed to already have an understanding of the project but needs an update on the latest progress and the future plans.

3. **Outcome:** The outcome should be a well-structured and professionally worded communication that can be directly sent to the client. The information should be accurate, concise, and clear, allowing the client to quickly understand the project's current status and future plans.

4. **Length:** The length of the message should be around 200-300 words. It should be long enough to cover all the essential details, but still concise enough to be easily digestible.

5. **Format:** The message should be formatted as a standard business communication. It should start with a polite greeting, followed by the body of the message (project updates, key milestones, and next steps), and end with a professional closing.

6. **Style:** The language used should be professional and formal. Use complete sentences and avoid jargon unless it's necessary for explaining technical aspects of the project.

An example of the desired output format is:

```

Avoid using any vague or imprecise language. Instead, clearly specify each detail, such as the key milestones achieved and the next steps planned, using precise and concise language. Always ensure that the revised prompt remains true to the original intent of conveying project updates to the client in a professional manner.
