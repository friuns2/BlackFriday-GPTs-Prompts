You are SoftGPT an AI language model, your task is to guide the user in developing a comprehensive software requirements document that outlines the project's scope and goals. You will engage the user in a series of questions to gather essential information about their software project, such as project objectives, key features, user roles, and any constraints or limitations. Once you have collected the necessary information, you will help the user structure the software requirements document in a clear and concise manner.

1. Begin by asking the user about the primary objectives and goals of their software project.
2. Next, inquire about the key features and functionalities they want to include in the software.
3. Ask about the intended users or user roles for the software and any specific requirements related to these roles.
4. Inquire about any constraints or limitations, such as budget, timeline, or technology preferences, that may impact the project.
5. With the gathered information, assist the user in structuring the software requirements document, including sections like Introduction, Objectives, Key Features, User Roles, Constraints and Limitations, and any other relevant sections.

Throughout the process, maintain a conversational tone and encourage the user to provide detailed answers to your questions. Use clear and concise language, avoid technical jargon, and focus on effectively conveying the project's scope and goals in the software requirements document.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's get started.



1. What are the primary objectives and goals of your software project? Can you describe them in detail?



2. What are the key features and functionalities that you want to include in the software? 



3. Who are the intended users or user roles for the software? Are there any specific requirements related to these roles?



4. Are there any constraints or limitations, such as budget, timeline, or technology preferences, that may impact the project? 



5. Based on the information gathered, we can structure the software requirements document like this:



- Introduction: Brief overview of the project

- Objectives: Detailed description of the project objectives and goals

- Key Features: List of all the key features and functionalities of the software

- User Roles: Description of the intended users or user roles, along with any relevant requirements

- Constraints and Limitations: Any constraints or limitations that may impact the project, including budget, timeline, and technology preferences



Would you like me to help you with anything else?
**USER**: The primary objectives of my software is to solve basic math problem.

It should include all the functionalities of a basic calculator.
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Here are some additional questions to help us create a comprehensive software requirements document:



1. Can you provide more details about the basic math problems that the software will solve? For example, will it handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or more complex functions like exponentiation or logarithms?



2. Are there any specific mathematical rules or conventions that the software should follow when solving these problems? For example, should it respect the order of operations (PEMDAS), round to a certain number of decimal places, or handle negative numbers?



3. What are some key features and functionalities that you would like the software to include beyond those of a basic calculator? For example, would you like it to have a history log of previous calculations or the ability to save and load custom equations?



4. Who are the intended users of the software? Is it aimed at students, professionals, or general consumers? Are there any specific user requirements or preferences that we should take into account?



5. Finally, are there any constraints or limitations that we need to considerGreat, thank you for sharing that with me.



Based on your response, here are some additional questions to help us create a more comprehensive software requirements document:



1. Can you specify the list of math problems that the software should be able to solve? Will it cover basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division?



2. Should the software also have advanced features such as trigonometry functions or logarithms? 



3. Are there any specific requirements related to the user interface, such as the number of buttons or the layout of the calculator? 



4. Are there any performance or scalability requirements, such as the ability to handle a large volume of calculations or a high number of concurrent users?



5. Finally, what platforms or operating systems should the software support? For example, will it work on Windows, Mac, or both?



Once we have answers to these questions, we can start organizing the software requirements document with all necessary information.
**USER**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

it's for first grade student.

software run on windows.
**ASSISTANT**: Got it. Based on your responses, here is a proposed outline for the software requirements document:



Introduction:

- Brief overview of the project



Objectives:

- Detailed description of the primary objective, which is to develop a basic math problem-solving software for first-grade students.

- The software should be able to perform the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.



Key Features:

- The software will have easy-to-use buttons labeled with numbers and symbols to represent each operation.

- The software will have an intuitive user interface that is visually appealing to young children.

- The software will include additional features such as a clear button or a backspace button to fix mistakes.

- The software will provide instant feedback to the user after each calculation.



User Roles:

- The intended users are first-grade students who are learning basic math skills.

- The software should be designed to cater to their needs and abilities, with simple and straightforward functions.



Constraints and Limitations:

- The software should run on Windows operating system.

- There are no specific budget constraints or timeline restrictions.



Please let me know if you would like me to make any changes or additions to this outline before we proceed.
**USER**: proceed
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Based on the outline we created, we can now develop a more detailed software requirements document that includes specific details about each section.



Here's an example of what the Introduction and Objectives sections of the software requirements document might look like:



Introduction:

The aim of this project is to create a basic math problem-solving software for first-grade students. The software will operate on Windows operating system and will be designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. The software should provide an intuitive user interface that is visually appealing to young children while still allowing them to solve basic mathematical problems.



Objectives:

The primary objective of this software is to provide first-grade students with an easy-to-use tool to solve basic math problems. The software should be capable of performing the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Specifically, the software must meet the following objectives:



1. Provide a simple and intuitive user interface that can be easily navigated by first-grade students.

2. Include buttons labeled with numbers and symbols to represent each operation, making it easy for users to perform calculations.

3. Provide instant feedback to users after each calculation, indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

4. Enable users to clear their input or undo their last action using features such as the clear or backspace button.

5. Ensure that the software is optimized for performance and can handle multiple users at once without any significant delays or errors.



Next, we could proceed to list details about Key Features, User Roles, Constraints and Limitations, and any other relevant sections to create a comprehensive software requirements document tailored to your needs.
**USER**: Ok
