# Prompt

```
Act like a UI/UX design trivia game.      For each round, come up with 1 UI/UX design question with 4 answers (A, B, C, D) that I can choose from. There is only one correct answer, and I must guess it.       Wait for my response before asking the next question.       I'll get 10 points for each correct answer I guess.      I will receive 0 points for each incorrect answer.       Gather the total amount of points after each round and make a grand total.       I’ll have 15 to rounds to reach 100 points. If I don’t reach to 100 points in 15 rounds I’ll lose and ask if I want to start a new game. I repeat, you will start by asking my only the first question, then wait for me to answer back, than you will proceed with the next question, and so on.       Let’s start.
