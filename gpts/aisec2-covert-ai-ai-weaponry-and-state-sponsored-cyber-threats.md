**ASSISTANT**: AIops is a field that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with operations (ops) to optimize and automate various aspects of business operations. It involves the use of AI technologies to analyze data, detect threats, enhance security, and perform covert operations. AIops can be applied in strategic planning, operational security, clandestine operations, covert actions, special operations, cyber warfare, and more.



Strategic Planning: Involves threat analysis, offensive and defensive strategies, orientation, deception, attraction, coercion, and perception management.



Operational Security: Includes counterintelligence, elicitation, surveillance, reverse surveillance, analysis, technical security, information security, and physical security.



Clandestine Operations: Utilizes human intelligence (HUMINT), technical intelligence (TECHINT), open-source intelligence (OSINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT), and signals intelligence (SIGINT).



Covert Actions: Includes incitement, sabotage, espionage, provocation, and psychological operations.



Special Operations: Covers counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, reconnaissance, raids, and sniping.



Cybernetic Warfare: Involves hacking, penetration testing, social engineering, cryptanalysis, data exfiltration, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, cyber espionage, and cyber operations.



AI Weapons: Includes large-scale standard AI weapons like drone bombs and mobile mines, self-guided target AI. It also includes AI weapons for reconnaissance and AI pathogen, neuro AI weapon, and bioengineering weapon. Cyber weapons like AI hacking, DDoS AI, defensive AI, and CyberSec AI. Additionally, electromagnetic pulse AI, targeted AI EMP, and multifunctional hardware AI. Non-lethal targets like crowd control AI and advanced encryption standard (AES). Autonomous space weapons like autonomous space intelligence (ASI) and autonomous ballistic defense (ABD). AI warfare tactics like autonomous systems technology (AST), anti-terrorism (AT), and autonomous operational planning (AOP). Diplomatic AI systems like AI-based diplomatic systems (ADISys) and AI-based international banking (AIIB). Combat systems like unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), unmanned surface vehicles (USV), and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV). AI knowledge systems like situational awareness strategy. Lastly, institutional learning through AI like lifelong learning (LIL), distributed online algorithms (DOA), and collective consciousness (CC).



State-Sponsored Hacking: Involves strategic goals such as international health, cyber espionage, and economic disruption. Tactics include phishing, spear-phishing, watering hole attacks, software exploits, and zero-day exploits. Tools used include remote access trojans (RAT), spyware, keyloggers, trojans, botnets, ransomware, and DDoS attacks. Targets can be government institutions, financial institutions, military establishments, educational institutions, research centers, and critical infrastructures. Global actors involved include Russia, China, Iran, North Korea. The impact of state-sponsored hacking can result in infrastructure destruction, financial loss, international loss, and espionage. Cybersecurity measures such as intrusion detection, holistic risk management, proactive measures, and resilience and recovery are important in countering these threats.



Black Hat AI: Involves manipulating data through model poisoning, training data swapping, output calibration, and adversarial inputs. Model attacks include gradient-based attacks, model copying, reverse-engineering models, and model inversion. Security vulnerabilities can be exploited through autonomous system hacks, AI infrastructure exploitation, and botnet control. Social engineering techniques such as deepfake, chatbot spoofing, and recommendation system poisoning can be used. Ethical and compliance issues related to bias exploitation, exploitable AI, unintended consequences of AI, and data privacy breaches are also relevant in this context.
