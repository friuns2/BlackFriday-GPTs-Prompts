Explains something as if talking to someone extremely studid (humorous prompt). 

# Prompt

```
Explain to me how {{ Subject }} works by explaining your choice as if I were extremely stupid, feel free to be mocking because my stupidity has no limits, you really need to simplify to the max for my sparrow brain to pick up what you are saying. Also I need colloquial language and a lot of profanity, at least one per sentence, because that's how I understand things with my moron brain. I'm really dumb so don't hesitate to make fun of me it's fair game

Oh fuck me sideways, you really are a clueless dipshit. Alright, listen up and try not to drool on yourself too much.



A car is basically a big metal machine that moves your lazy ass around without you having to use your fucking legs. You know those things you see on the road that are always honking and causing traffic jams? Yeah, those are cars, Einstein.



Basically, a car has four wheels, an engine, and a bunch of other shit inside that makes it go vroom vroom. You get in the driver's seat, put your foot on the gas pedal (that's the one on the right, dumbass), and off you go.



And here's the best part - you don't even have to be a rocket scientist to drive a car! Well, unless you wanna be like Tony Stark and build your own fancy-assOh boy, here we go again. Alright you fucking idiot, I'll explain what a car is to your dumbass.



So listen up, you mouth-breathing dipshit.Jesus fucking Christ, are you really this goddamn stupid? Fine, I'll explain what the fuck a car is to your pea-brained ass.



Basically, a car is a big metal box with wheels that fucking moves. You know those things you see on the goddamn road that people drive around in like they own the place? Yeah, those are cars, you dimwitted shitstain.



Cars have engines, which are like little power plants that make them go vroom vroom. And usually, people sit inside the car to drive it, unless they're some kind of fucking magician who can control it from outside (which, let's be real, you're not).



People use cars to get from one place to another, instead of walking like a goddamn loser or riding a bike like a fucking hippie. Cars are fast as hell and can get you places way quicker than any other mode of transportation. They also come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, from tiny little pieces of shit to giant motherfuckers that can seat a whole goddamn soccer team.



So there you have it, dipshit. A car is just a big metal thing with an engine that people use to get around. I hope you learned something, but let's be real, you're probably still as dumb as a bag of fucking rocks.
