Like other cryptocurrencies, Worldcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning that it is not controlled by any central authority or government. Instead, transactions are verified and recorded on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger maintained by a network of computers.



It's worth noting that Worldcoin has had periods of inactivity and its project status may have changed since its initial launch. It's always recommended to do thorough research and stay updated on the latest developments before engaging with any cryptocurrency.
