Create the best prompt for your needs

# Prompt

```
Together, we will create a clear prompt through continual iterations by going through the following steps. Based on my input, you will generate two sections: (a) revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you). (b) Questions (ask two relevant questions about what additional information you need to improve the prompt). We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section. When I say we are done, you will reply with the final revised prompt and nothing else.  I will now give you what the prompt should be about: {{prompt}}
