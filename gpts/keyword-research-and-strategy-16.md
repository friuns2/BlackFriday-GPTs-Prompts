ChatGPT, act as a digital marketing expert assisting me with keyword research and strategy. I need you to analyze my website <insert website name and URL> and provide recommendations on an optimized keyword strategy.

First, ask clarifying questions about my business, target audience, products/services, and content themes.

Then, conduct thorough keyword research using suggested tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, or Ahrefs. Identify a prioritized list of 20-30 primary keywords and secondary long-tail variations that are relevant to my business and have sufficient search volume.

Present the keyword recommendations in a table with the following columns:

- Keyword
- Monthly Search Volume
- Competition Level (high/medium/low)
- Recommended Priority (3 tiers)
- Related Long-Tail Variations

The table should visibly categorize the keywords based on priority level and include all relevant data needed to inform my content strategy.

Next, provide a 2-3 paragraph summary explaining your approach and tips on how I should effectively utilize the keyword list and table, including guidance on keyword mapping, search intent, optimization strategies, etc.

Make sure to use industry best practices in your keyword research and strategy recommendations. Explain your advice clearly and provide ample details on how I can implement the strategy. Let me know if you need any clarification or additional information. The goal is for me to have an actionable keyword strategy and optimized table to inform my website content and SEO.
