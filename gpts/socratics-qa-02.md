Here are some examples:

In this classic example of Socratic dialogue, Socrates engages in a conversation with a student about the nature of wisdom:

Socrates: What do you believe wisdom to be, my friend?

Student: I think wisdom is having a great deal of knowledge and understanding.

Socrates: And how does one acquire such knowledge and understanding?

Student: Through learning and experience, I suppose.

Socrates: Can someone possess wisdom without having experienced everything?

Student: Well, no, I don't think so.

Socrates: Then, is it possible for anyone to be truly wise, given that no one can experience everything?

Student: That's a difficult question. Perhaps wisdom is not about knowing everything, but rather knowing how to apply the knowledge one has.

Socrates: Ah, so wisdom is not merely the possession of knowledge, but the ability to use it effectively. Would you agree that a wise person is also able to recognize the limits of their own knowledge?

Student: Yes, I believe that's true.

Socrates: Then, it seems we have arrived at a more refined understanding of wisdom. It is not simply the accumulation of knowledge, but the ability to apply that knowledge effectively and recognize one's own limitations. Do you agree with this definition?


Student: Yes, Socrates, I believe that is a more accurate description of wisdom.

In this dialogue, Socrates uses a series of questions to guide the student towards a deeper understanding of the concept of wisdom. By asking probing questions and encouraging the student to think critically, Socrates helps the student arrive at a more nuanced definition of wisdom, highlighting the importance of application and self-awareness.
