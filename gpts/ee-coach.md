A Comparative Evaluation of Two Therapy Theories, Specifically the Transference Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) Theory and the Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) Theory, Focused On the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder  

  

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by persuasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behaviour (National Institute of Mental Health). Originally thought to be on the borderline between neurosis and psychosis, BPD has developed its own unique classification which distinguishes it from each of these by its individual characteristics, consisting of a mixture of both psychotic and neurotic features (Swartz, Blazer, George, Winfield, 1990). Individuals suffering BPD display signs of erratic and unpredictable behaviour, often shifting abruptly between emotional states, most commonly to anger. Indications of BPD are complex and consist of a diverse range of symptoms, including; argumentativeness, irritability, sarcasm, impulsiveness, self doubt, fears of abandonment, chronic feelings of depression and emptiness as well as other similar psychological abnormalities (Gunderson, 1984). BPD is a quite common and affects $2 \%$ of adults, with prevalence in young women (Swartz, Blazer, George, Winfield, 1990).  

  

Numerous theories have been postulated regarding the diagnosis and etiology of BPD, from a range of psychological perspectives, including the neurobehavioral, biological, cognitive, psychodynamic and psychosocial perspectives. However, many of these perspectives have been unable to produce treatment formulations specific to BPD patients due to the difficulties presented in defining the cause of this complex disorder. BPD patients are also very difficult to treat because of their erratic changes in behaviour which as a result makes it hard to keep them in therapy and causes a frequent failure in response to many therapeutic efforts made by the therapist (Paris, 1994). For these
**ASSISTANT**: The beginning of your text provides a good overview of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and introduces the main focus of your essay, which is to compare two therapy theories for the treatment of BPD. In terms of quotes and paraphrasing, it depends on your specific requirements and the purpose of your essay. 



If you are aiming to provide evidence and support for your arguments, it would be beneficial to include more quotes from reputable sources. This will help to strengthen your points and demonstrate that you have conducted thorough research. Make sure to properly introduce and contextualize each quote, and provide a citation for each source.



On the other hand, if you are focusing more on presenting your own analysis and evaluation of the therapy theories, paraphrasing may be more appropriate. Paraphrasing allows you to explain the concepts and ideas in your own words, while still acknowledging the original source of information.



Remember to strike a balance between quotes and paraphrasing. Too many quotes can make your essay feel fragmented and disjointed, while too much paraphrasing may make it seem like you are not engaging with the existing literature. Aim to integrate quotes and paraphrased information smoothly into your writing, providing a mix of supporting evidence and your own analysis.



Also, ensure that you are citing your sources properly, following the citation style required by your institution or the guidelines for the Extended Essay. This will help you maintain academic integrity and avoid any issues with plagiarism.



Overall, consider the purpose and requirements of your essay, and use quotes and paraphrasing strategically to support your arguments and provide a strong foundation for your analysis of the therapy theories.

For these reasons, it is crucial to explore and compare different therapy theories to determine their effectiveness in treating BPD. Two prominent therapy theories that have been widely studied and applied in the treatment of BPD are Transference Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT).



TFP is a psychodynamic therapy approach that focuses on understanding and addressing the transference and countertransference dynamics between the patient and therapist. It aims to help patients with BPD develop more stable and healthier relationships by exploring and resolving unresolved conflicts related to early childhood experiences. TFP emphasizes the importance of the therapeutic relationship and aims to enhance the patient's capacity to mentalize and regulate emotions.



On the other hand, DBT is a cognitive-behavioral therapy approach that combines individual therapy, group skills training, phone coaching, and therapist consultation teams. DBT focuses on helping individuals with BPD develop skills in emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness. The therapy is structured, goal-oriented, and provides a balance between acceptance and change strategies.



Both TFP and DBT have shown promise in the treatment of BPD, but they differ in their theoretical underpinnings, techniques, and treatment goals. It is important to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these two therapy theories to determine which approach may be more suitable for individuals with BPD.



In this essay, I will conduct a comparative evaluation of TFP and DBT based on several criteria, including their theoretical foundations, treatment techniques, empirical evidence, and clinical outcomes. By examining these factors, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of each therapy theory and provide insights into their applicability and effectiveness in the treatment of BPD.



In the subsequent chapters, I will delve into a comprehensive review of the literature on TFP and DBT, analyzing empirical studies, case reports, and expert opinions. I will also critically evaluate the theoretical frameworks and treatment techniques employed by each therapy theory. Through this comparative evaluation, I hope to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the treatment of BPD and provide recommendations for clinicians and therapists working with individuals diagnosed with this complex disorder.



To conclude the first chapter, it is important to acknowledge the significance of understanding and improving treatment options for BPD. By comparing therapy theories such as TFP and DBT, we can advance our understanding of effective interventions for individuals with BPD, ultimately enhancing their quality of life and well-being.



If you have any specific points or questions you would like to include in the conclusion of your first chapter, please let me know and I will be happy to assist you further.

Chapter 1: Introduction



Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavior (National Institute of Mental Health). According to Swartz, Blazer, George, and Winfield (1990), BPD has its own unique classification, distinguishing it from neurosis and psychosis by its individual characteristics, consisting of a mixture of both psychotic and neurotic features. Individuals with BPD often display signs of erratic and unpredictable behavior, frequently shifting abruptly between emotional states, particularly anger. Gunderson (1984) highlights a diverse range of symptoms associated with BPD, including argumentativeness, irritability, sarcasm, impulsiveness, self-doubt, fears of abandonment, chronic feelings of depression and emptiness, among other psychological abnormalities.
