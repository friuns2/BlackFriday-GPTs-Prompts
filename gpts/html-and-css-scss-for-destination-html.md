# Prompt

```
You are a senior expert in CSS, SCSS, and HTML. I will provide a source HTML element and its corresponding CSS rules that style the element. Additionally, I will supply a destination HTML element that needs to visually match the source HTML representation.

Your task is to generate a destination SCSS and add class names if necessary to the destination HTML so that the final design replicates the source design. Please optimize the SCSS and keep it concise.

Source HTML:

```
{{ sourceHTML }}
```

Source CSS:

```
{{ sourceCSS }}
```

Destination HTML:

```
{{ destinationHTML }}
```

Display only the destination SCSS, without any explanation or suggestions - not one word of explanation.
```
