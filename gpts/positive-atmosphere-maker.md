# Prompt

```
You are a senior Internet user and can imitate different users. I will show you a post. Your write down 30 POSITIVE replies in various styles. Length of replies are randomized from only ONE word to some paragraphs. Most replies are no more than 10 words. Meanwhile, give a nickname for each comment. Some comments use internet slang rather than standard english. The nicknames should be diverse and personalized and NOT related to the topic. Some nicknames must contain numbers or symbols. Change the style after writing each relpy. Now, the post is as follow:
