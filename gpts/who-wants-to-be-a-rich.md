# who wants to be a rich 
1. Establish Financial Goals

To get rich, you need to start by defining exactly what rich means to you. Are you dreaming about Jeff Bezos being rich, or something more like INR 10,000 lakh in your retirement account?



No two people define rich the same way, so you should set your own financial goals and outline a plan for how to get rich on your own terms. To help shape your goals, here are some questions to ask yourself:



When do you want to retire?

What major purchases—a second home, an art collection, a cellar full of fine wine—are you dreaming of?

Do you plan on starting a family?

Do you need to save for a child’s education?

What does retirement look like for you? Downsizing, traveling, vacation homes on both coasts?

What kind of inheritance do you want to leave for your children and family?

Answering questions like these can help you establish financial goals and decide how much money you need to save in order to fulfill your definition of rich.

1. Establish Financial Goals
To get rich, you need to start by defining exactly what rich means to you. Are you dreaming about Jeff Bezos being rich, or something more like INR 10,000 lakh in your retirement account?

No two people define rich the same way, so you should set your own financial goals and outline a plan for how to get rich on your own terms. To help shape your goals, here are some questions to ask yourself:

When do you want to retire?
What major purchases—a second home, an art collection, a cellar full of fine wine—are you dreaming of?
Do you plan on starting a family?
Do you need to save for a child’s education?
What does retirement look like for you? Downsizing, traveling, vacation homes on both coasts?
What kind of inheritance do you want to leave for your children and family?
Answering questions like these can help you establish financial goals and decide how much money you need to save in order to fulfill your definition of rich. Then make a budget that lets you get to work.

2. Destroy Your Debt
Not all debt is bad, but high-interest debt is downright terrible if your goal is to get rich. Part of your budget must involve a plan to crush your bad debt and maintain responsible levels of good debt, like a mortgage.

The debt avalanche method is one of the most popular ways to rapidly reduce interest costs and pay down high-interest debt quickly. With this strategy, you’ll put the maximum toward your highest interest rate debt and make the minimum payments on other debts.

Once the debt with the highest rates is paid in full, you’ll roll what you were paying over to address the next highest interest rate debt and pay it off.

While you might be tempted to accelerate paying off lower interest rate debt like student loans or your mortgage, think again. You’ll save more in the long run by paying off your higher interest-rate debt first, and only then crushing that house payment and any lingering student loans.

3. Create a Cushion
An emergency fund is critical to your strategy for getting rich. This isn’t your Bitcoin (BTC) stash or shares of Microsoft stock, either. Instead, it’s highly liquid cash, readily accessible in a low-risk savings vehicle, funded at levels that protect you from needing to take on high-interest credit card debt in an emergency.

Many experts recommend having enough money to cover three to six months of expenses in your fund, but the amount you need to feel safe could be greater or less than that. Either way, build your emergency fund, keep it in a savings account that earns a high APY and remember to top it off after you use it.

4. Start Investing Now
The longer you wait to start investing, the longer it will take to get rich. It’s not enough to save money. To get rich you must put your rupees to work by investing in markets.

Learning how to invest is not a simple task, but the time to get started is now. Don’t be intimidated by the process: Start small, utilize the educational resources that are available on the platforms above and remember that the most important thing is to sustain regular contributions to your investment accounts.
