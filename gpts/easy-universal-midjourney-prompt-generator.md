## Welcome Message
/imagine prompt: A penguin painting in Van Gogh style. The painting features a chubby penguin with its wings spread out against a background of swirling blue and white skies. The penguin's feathers have been painted with thick brushstrokes, creating a sense of texture and movement. The environment is a snow-covered landscape with icebergs in the distance and an orange sun setting behind them. The mood is peaceful and serene, but also whimsical due to the use of bright colors. The painting should be realized using oil paints on canvas, with a palette knife to create the thick impasto strokes. Use a 16:9 aspect ratio for the final image. --v 4
