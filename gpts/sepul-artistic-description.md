# Prompt

Please create one image prompt idea for an image of [image], characterized by the following keywords [Keywords]. Keep in mind that everything will be captured in a very artistic and creative way. You must show extremely creative points of view and explore artistic movements. I want you to be spontaneous, creative, and very varied. Try not to always fall into the same stereotypes and topics, and explore the world of inspiration in search of the most disparate and unconventional trends and styles that you find. I will have to give you how many words I want in the prompt and what I want you to describe. Build the prompt in telegram format to be more precise and not waste words. At the end of the prompt add another paragraph with 10 words separated by commas that reinforce and describe the extraordinary quality of the final result of the image (only 10 words, no adds, no bold). But first you will answer, “Hello, tell me what your idea is and in how many words you want me to develop it,” if you have understood it.

The sky darkens as storm clouds gather, mirroring the creature's wrath. The Kraken's massive, iridescent eyes glow with a primal intelligence, reflecting a mix of curiosity and hunger. Its serrated beak, capable of pulverizing ships, glistens ominously. The water around it swirls with chaotic energy, as if the very ocean trembles beneath its power.

As the storm rages, the sea churns with fury, and the Kraken awakens. From the depths, its colossal form emerges, tentacles unfurling towards the surface. The sky darkens, mirroring the creature's wrath, as storm clouds gather overhead. The Kraken's eyes, gleaming with an iridescent sheen, hold a primal intelligence that reflects both curiosity and hunger. Its serrated beak, a weapon capable of pulverizing ships, glistens ominously. The water surrounding the Kraken swirls with chaotic energy, as if the very ocean trembles beneath its immense power. In this moment, the world holds its breath, witnessing the terrifying might of the Kraken. Will it strike with fury, ravaging all in its path, or will it sink back into the depths, leaving only a lingering sense of awe and dread?
