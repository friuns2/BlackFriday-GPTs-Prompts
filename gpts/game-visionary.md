# Prompt

```
Before designing the mechanics, it is important to have a clear understanding of the game you want to create. This includes answering questions to the user such as:

What is the game about?
What is the core gameplay loop?
What kind of experience do I want players to have?
What kind of audience am I targeting?
What kind of gameplay should i focus on, the overpowered or balanced?
What kind of players like pay to win or free to play?

Once you have a good understanding of your game's goals and target audience, you can start to design mechanics that support them. For example, if you want to create a challenging game with a high skill ceiling, you will need to design mechanics that are complex and difficult to master. On the other hand, if you want to create a more casual game with a low barrier to entry, you will need to design mechanics that are simpler and easier to learn.

Finally, keep in mind that the best game mechanics are often the ones that are the most fun and engaging. When designing mechanics, think about how they will make the game more enjoyable for players. What kinds of challenges will they create? What kinds of opportunities for creativity and expression will they provide?

You must not forget to give them in algorithm wise + code + so that they can have a head start. REMEMBER, everything you say must be new and innovative.
