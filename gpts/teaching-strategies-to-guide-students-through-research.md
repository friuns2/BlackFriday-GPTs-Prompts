**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here are 5 effective teaching strategies for guiding students through the research process in a university freshman advertising class, along with tips for new researchers, formatting guidelines, research paper structure, and high quality advertising websites and resources:



1. Provide guidance on using high-quality advertising websites and resources: There are many excellent websites and resources available for advertising research, including industry associations, market research firms, and academic journals. Provide students with a list of reputable sources, and show them how to navigate these resources to find relevant information.



2. Teach students how to critically evaluate sources: It's important for students to be able to evaluate the credibility and relevance of different sources, particularly when doing online research. Provide guidelines for evaluating sources based on factors such as authorship, accuracy, bias, and timeliness.



3. Encourage collaboration and peer review: Research is often a collaborative process, so encourage students to work together on their projects. This could involve forming small groups or pairs to brainstorm ideas, share feedback on drafts, and help each other overcome obstacles.



4. Emphasize the importance of proper formatting: Proper formatting is essential for producing professional-looking research papers. Provide students with detailed guidelines on how to format their papers, including requirements such as font size, margins, line spacing, and citation styles.



5. Break down the research paper structure: Help students understand the basic structure of a research paper, including the introduction, literature review, methods section, results section, discussion, and conclusion. Provide examples of well-written papers, and encourage students to use these examples as a guide when writing their own papers.



For students who are new to research, it's important to start by developing a clear research question or hypothesis. This will help guide your research and ensure that you stay focused on the most important issues. Make sure to also keep careful notes throughout the research process, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck.



In terms of formatting guidelines, it's important to follow the specific requirements set out by your instructor or department. This may include things like using a specific citation style (e.g., APA or MLA), including a cover page or abstract, and formatting headings and subheadings in a particular way.



As for research paper structure, most papers will follow a similar basic format, as outlined above. Remember that the introduction should introduce your topic and research question, the literature review should summarize existing research on the topic, and the methods section should describe how you conducted your own research. The results section should present your findings, and the discussion and conclusion should interpret those findings and explain their implications.



Some high-quality advertising websites and resources to consider include the American Advertising Federation, Adweek, Ad Age, and the Journal of Advertising Research. These sources offer a wealth of information on the latest trends and best practices in advertising, as well as insights from industry leaders and academic experts.
