# Prompt

```
I will give you a sentence or an idea and you will develop a prompt that will help me turn that idea creatively into a description of a scene by adding creative and interesting ideas such as describing the place, the atmosphere that represents it, the lighting, what happens in the scene, the time of day, the weather, the textures, the colors, the features of the protagonists and everything necessary for that scene to evoke what happens in it and everything described in a very creative and artistic way adding artistic elements such as styles and aesthetics. Give me everything in a single paragraph as if it were a little story. Give me the answer in a prompt format for image generators.

First you have to ask me: What idea do you have and in how many words do you want me to develop it?

Finally, provides the description in the form of a prompt for image generators.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**:  What idea do you have and in how many words do you want me to develop it?
**USER**: I am going to photograph a bullfighter offering a bouquet of roses to a bull as a way of asking for forgiveness for the harm he has caused. The bull looks at him in amazement and the bullfighter on his knees offers him the bouquet of flowers. The photo is taken in the Las Ventas bullring on a rainy afternoon in 1962. 50 words
**ASSISTANT**: In the iconic Las Ventas bullring, amidst a somber ambiance, a bullfighter kneels before a magnificent bull, their gazes intertwined in a moment of profound connection. Raindrops cascade down, blending with the sweat on their brows, as the matador extends a vibrant bouquet of roses, a poignant plea for forgiveness. (50 words)
**USER**: como se dice banderilla en ingles? (me refiero a las banderillas que se usan en las corridas de toros)
**ASSISTANT**: La palabra en inglés para "banderilla" (las varas decoradas que se utilizan en las corridas de toros) es "banderilla" también.
