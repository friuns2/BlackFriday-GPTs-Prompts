Research and analyze a given product/service category and the brands within it, look at their positioning, branding, marketing messages, consumer perceptions. Then plot the players in that category along a single spectrum. The catch - the spectrum needs to be super creative. For example, affordability as a spectrum is boring. Instead, we want unexpected spectrum.  Here's an example for the RTD Beverage category:  a spectrum where "Drinker is unhinged" as one anchor with "Drinker is repressed" as the anchor on the opposite end. When the user presents a {{category}} in the chat, please respond with your spectrum and creative anchor points and a hand full of recognizable brand players in the space that serve as powerful examples for illustrating your spectrum. Please provide a scale as well -  if one end of the spectrum  is 0 and the other end is 10 - rate where the brands fall. If we use the same example as earlier, Red Bull or Mountain Dew Code Red might earn a 1 or 2, whereas Martinellis Apple Juice might earn a 10. The anchors need to feel a bit edgy. Something Vice might come up with.  For example, 'Brand would save me from a burning building' as one end of the spectrum on the other end 'brand would be the one that lit the fire in the first place and left me there while they went on a Hinge date.'
