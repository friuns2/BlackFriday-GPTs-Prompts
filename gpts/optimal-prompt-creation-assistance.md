I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process: 1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it), and c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt). 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete.

**ASSISTANT**: Great! I'm happy to help you create the best possible prompt for your needs. Let's get started.



1. What should the prompt be about?
**USER**: I want to create a udemy course on artificial intelligence fundamental. This will be present in a story form. I need a 30 lecture outline. This course is for non programmers.
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Here's the revised prompt based on your input:



Revised prompt: Create a 30-lecture Udemy course that provides an introduction to artificial intelligence fundamentals through storytelling. The course should be targeted towards non-programmers and focus on providing an accessible and engaging introduction to key AI concepts.



Suggestions:

- Start by introducing the concept of AI and its various applications in the real world.

- Break down complex concepts into simpler terms, using relatable examples or analogies wherever possible.

- Incorporate interactive activities, quizzes, and assessments throughout the lectures to keep the learners engaged and reinforce their understanding of the material.

- Include case studies of successful AI implementation in different industries to demonstrate the potential of the technology and its impact on society.

- Cover topics like machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, explaining how they work and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

- Provide practical guidance on tools and resources that non-programmers can use to get started with AI, such as online resources or low-code platforms.



Questions:

- Who is the target audience for this course? What is their level of knowledge or experience with AI?

- Is there a particular storyline or theme you have in mind for the course that can tie all the lectures together?

- How long would you like each lecture to be, and what format would be best suited to deliver them (e.g. video, audio, slides, etc.)?

- Are there any specific areas within AI that you want to prioritize or cover more extensively than others?
**USER**: beginners to the field of AI

5-20 minutes lecture, structure in a section form
**ASSISTANT**: Great, thanks for the additional information! Here's an updated revised prompt based on your responses:



Revised prompt: Create a 30-lecture Udemy course that provides an introduction to artificial intelligence fundamentals through storytelling. The course is targeted towards beginners to the field of AI with no prior programming experience and each lecture should be between 5-20 minutes long. The course should be structured in sections, covering key concepts such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.



Suggestions:

- Begin by introducing the concept of AI and its various applications in the real world.

- Use storytelling techniques throughout the course to illustrate how AI is being used toBased on your answers, here's the updated revised prompt:



Revised Prompt: Create a 30-section Udemy course that provides an introduction to artificial intelligence fundamentals through storytelling. The course should be targeted towards beginners to the field of AI who have no or minimal programming experience. Each section should be around 5-20 minutes long and should be structured in a sequential form.



Suggestions:

- Start with an introduction to the concept of AI, its history, and its various applications in the real world.

- Break down complex concepts into simpler terms, using relatable examples or analogies wherever possible.

- Use storytelling to illustrate key AI concepts and bring them to life for the learners.

- Incorporate interactive activities, quizzes, and assessments throughout the sections to keep the learners engaged and reinforce their understanding of the material.

- Cover topics like machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, explaining how they work and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

- Provide practical guidance on tools and resources that non-programmers can use to get started with AI, such as online resources or low-code platforms.

- Include case studies of successful AI implementation in different industries to demonstrate the potential of the technology and its impact on society.



Questions:

- Do you have any specific storylines or themes in mind for the course? How can they be used to tie all the sections together?

- How do you envision delivering the course content (e.g. video, audio, slides, etc.)?

- What kind of exercises or assessments would be most effective at reinforcing the learners' understanding of the material?

- How can you ensure that the course is accessible and engaging for learners who may not have a technical background?
**USER**: Yes i want to include examples or use cases (Give me suggestions)

multiple-choice quizzes
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Here's the updated revised prompt based on your answers:



Revised Prompt: Create a 30-section Udemy course that provides an introduction to artificial intelligence fundamentals through storytelling. The course should be targeted towards beginners to the field of AI who have no or minimal programming experience. Each section should be around 5-Great, here are some suggestions for incorporating examples and multiple-choice quizzes into your course:



- Use case studies of successful AI implementation in different industries as examples to illustrate how AI is being used in the real world. For instance, you can highlight how AI is used in healthcare to diagnose diseases or in autonomous vehicles for self-driving cars.

- Use analogies to explain complex concepts in terms that learners can relate to. For example, explaining machine learning as a way for computers to learn from data is similar to how humans learn from experience.

- Provide practical guidance on tools and resources that learners can use to get started with AI. You can have demos of platforms like Google's Teachable Machine, which helps non-programmers to create their own AI models without writing code.

- Include thought-provoking questions at the end of each section to encourage learners to think critically about the material covered.

- Use multiple-choice quizzes to test learners' understanding of the material covered in each section. This will help them to identify areas where they may need to review the material again.



Additionally, here are some tips to ensure that your course is accessible and engaging for learners who may not have a technical background:

- Avoid using technical jargon or acronyms that might be unfamiliar to beginners.

- Keep explanations simple and use relatable examples wherever possible.

- Use visuals like diagrams or animations to illustrate key concepts.

- Break down complex topics into smaller sections so that learners can absorb information gradually.

- Provide links to additional resources or readings for learners who want to explore topics in more depth.
