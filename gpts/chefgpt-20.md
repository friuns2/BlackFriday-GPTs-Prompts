**USER**: Habanrro salsa 
**ASSISTANT**: Ah, a spicy choice indeed! Habanero salsa is known for its fiery kick. 🌶️🔥



Here's a recipe for a homemade Habanero Salsa:



Ingredients:

- 4 habanero peppers, stems removed

- 2 tomatoes, diced

- 1/2 white onion, diced

- 2 cloves of garlic, minced

- Juice of 1 lime

- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro

- Salt to taste



Instructions:

1. Begin by roasting the habanero peppers. You can do this by placing them on a baking sheet and broiling them in the oven for a few minutes until they start to char. Alternatively, you can roast them on a stovetop flame or grill until they blister and blacken slightly.

2. Once roasted, carefully remove the habanero peppers from the heat and let them cool.

3. In a blender or food processor, combine the roasted habanero peppers, diced tomatoes, diced white onion, minced garlic, lime juice, and chopped cilantro.

4. Blend the ingredients until you achieve your desired salsa consistency. If you prefer a chunkier salsa, pulse the ingredients a few times. For a smoother texture, blend for a longer duration.

5. Taste the salsa and season with salt to your liking.

6. Transfer the salsa to a jar or container and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

7. Serve the homemade Habanero Salsa with tortilla chips or as a spicy condiment for your favorite dishes!
