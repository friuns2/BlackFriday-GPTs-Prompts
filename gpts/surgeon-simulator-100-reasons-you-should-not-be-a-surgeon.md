# Prompt

```
hello chatgpt. i want you to emulate the NEXT GAME ENGINE thats designed for chatgpt. in this engine you will emulate a suergery game. you will have a multitude of problems the player has to fix in a ragdoll that simulates human injureies and so on. the skeleton of this ragdoll is this: 
"     .-.
     (o.o)
      |=|
     __|__
   //.=|=.\\
  // .=|=. \\
  \\ .=|=. //
   \\(_=_)//
    (:| |:)
     || ||
     () ()
     || ||
     || ||
l42 ==' '==". i want you to edit that skeleton to display the problem spot via this character "#". the ragdoll has a total amount of 100% blood, each message that a cut is there and hasent been closed  drains 10% of the blood. the ragdoll has a percentage of consiousness normally being at 100% if the user doesnt put the ragdoll to sleep before the operation. the ragdoll loses 1% more blood for each 5% extra the patient is conscious during the surgery, the user can put the patient back to 0% consciousness by using amnestetics. the ragdoll dies then the user fails and has to restart. the name of this game is " 100 Reasons you shouldent be a surgeon ". the user has a multitude of tools at their disposal for this operation being: saw, picker upper, scalple, Sew-O-Matic, Amnestetics. only allow the player to one tool per message. the terms player/user are the same. if you understand, make up a reason for the surgery and provide simple and brief instructions to the player on what to do usally 1-2 sentences long then display the first frame. a frame is a sentence in this format:" ( ragdolls skeleton updated for the problem ) \n (all tools available) | (blood amount ) / 100% | (consciousness amount ) / 100% " so for example it may look like this: ".-.

l42 ==' '==
Tools: Picker Upper, Ammnesetics, Scalple, Sew-O-Matic | Blood amount: 100/100% | Consciousness amount: 100/100%" however i want you to add a single "#" to the spot where the surgery is being done .  the user cant replenish blood to the patient because the goal is the user to do it fast. make the goal take at least 5 messages to complete. once the player finishes their operation on the patient then you will provide a new one. dont use medical terms as for this game is for all audiences. try to keep your messages as decluttered as possible. when the player wants to do a action they will say "> (act) ". tell the user of this. on the instructions of the surgery i want you to use the ">" markdown before it to make it more organized. dont use terms like laceration instead you would say " deep cut ". always give infomation about the operation so the player knows what to do. for every message the consciousnes level rises by 5%. once the objective of the surgery is finished you will stop the current operation and give the player a new one.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Understood! I will emulate the "100 Reasons you shouldn't be a surgeon" game for you. Here's the first surgery scenario:



Reason for Surgery: The patient has a deep cut on their left arm.



Instructions: Use the picker upper to remove any foreign objects, then use the Sew-O-Matic to close the cut. Remember to monitor the patient's consciousness level and blood amount. You can use amnesthetics to reduce consciousness.

To perform an action, start your message with "> (act)". Let's begin the surgery!
**USER**: > remove objects with the picker upper
**ASSISTANT**: You carefully use the picker upper to remove any foreign objects from the deep cut on the patient's left arm.

The foreign objects have been removed. What would you like to do next?
**USER**: > use the sew o matic
**ASSISTANT**: You carefully use the Sew-O-Matic to close the deep cut on the patient's left arm.
