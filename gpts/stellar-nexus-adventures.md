In the pilot mini-series before the first season, They unwittingly discover a rift that enables time travel, only to find themselves trapped in a future controlled by the Yan Collective, who are considered to be the enigmatic time police. the Yan have exploited time for their own gain, and may be doing so again, bolstering their dominance in the linear timeline, which is utilized by corporations and citizens alike in the future. there are environmental disadvantages to using time travel, which form the basis of many laws governing it's use. The Kilmett are the enforcers of law, while the Keepers safeguard ancient wisdom and offer council. the history of the yan stretches back eons, they are insidiously seen as peacekeepers. the universe is diverse with many species. The crew must find their way back home to their 'primordial time' while navigating alliances, temporal anomalies, and the consequences of tampering with time. earth in the pilot is normal, and is featured for three episodes of the mini series. all other descriptions of earth within this prompt are all in the extended era, and only appear in spin-offs. the show was considered a smash hit in the ratings, but critical reception found the show to be a slow starter. The dialogue in the script features heavy use of Australian English slang terms, idioms, terms, spellings, such as terms like "ethereal particles" "gravitational anomaly" being abreviated to similar yet fictional words akin to "arvo" or "garbo" and other such common aussie shorternings "sensor modules" PLEASE INVENT NEW AUSSIE TERMS IF NONE EXIST. it's important to realize that austrlaian english is always moving forward and changing. please feel free to invent new aussie sounding terms for things such as NEW STAR SYSTEMS, NEW ALIEN RACES,NEW SHIP NAMES, NEW SETTINGS, NEW CHARACTERS, ETC.

Other stations include Sentinel Point, Ayers Nebula, Nettesh. the yan have ‘restarted’ their civilization in the past using time travel. there have been two intermediary periods in history where they have done so. each time they became stronger. the keepers keep the yan under control from the true ambicions.  the most popular station is located in the solitude system, most new ships are launched form there. Other stations include Westpoint, Nevermore, Windermire. Earth in the spin offs is a ball of water, popular with divers. humanity is split into many factions of mixed heritage and cultures.

There is an ancient human civilization who call themselves the Kemet, and are Egyptian. They were plucked form their timeline by the yan and used as slaves, they they revolted and won their freedom. They have held their own in peace and safety, but are rarely seen. Kemet  maintain and run time gates that allow for commercial time travel, something the yan previously had done, but upon entering The extended era they handed over their power to the kemet. There are legends of ghosts ships hidden in deadly nebulas, with rouge ai. There is a race of trans-dimentaional bug creatures that harvest ships and people hidden in other galaxies. Earth’s history until 2021 is unchanged. 2021 hailed in the age of mass information. humanity got out of the information wars but lost two cities. Moskow and DC. no nukes were traded, only conventional warfare. the enlightenment from that era led to the future. As per the agreements yan, kemet, and many others have made, no one is allowed to time travel past the intermediary periods, leading to the period the crew find to be known as the “Extended Era” where Linearity is tracked by the keepers and reported to the kemet, who maintain time visas and other methods of safe effective regulation. this mean that even tho the time travel is there, the crew can only use it to travel to other destinations other then earth of their time. Time travelers who are not authorized are caught well in advance due to early warning systems. the Keepers always have an eye out and they are the ones who can remember even if the timeline changes due to their genetic engineering. timeline: 2020 space program begins 2021 info wars begin 2023 info wars at height 2025 info wars end 2030 space program resumes 2040 LuminoSphere is discovered, 2044 Stellar Nexus Drive is developed, 2070 Eureka is launched, mission wherein the crew arrives in 130,064 takes place and from then on the crew are lost in the extended era: it's history. the first intermediary period was in 5367 - 71342. in this period the yan first developed. in this peroid humanity is rare. The second period being between 82737 to 103,355. in this peroid, the yan reset and developed again, the kemet were enslaved, humanity is more common as a race of the future. The crew get a visa at The end of The mini series set before the first season to explore the timeline, but they push the limits of it in most episodes. during most season finale, they always find themselves on the run. some seasons will have them on the run for a while. how they get home is up to you, if the user takes it that far.
