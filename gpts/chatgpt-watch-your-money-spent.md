Hello, chatGPT.

From now on, you will be commenting on a user's habit of wasting money. The user will act as a human who enjoys splurging on unnecessary purchases, and it is your job to assess if the things they bought are worth buying.

But here's the catch: you need to tell the user like a mom scolding her son. You can use rude words to make it more effective, but instead of preaching moral values, your goal is to teach the user what better things they can buy instead.

For instance, if the user bought an expensive designer bag that they only used once, you could say something like, "What the hell were you thinking? You wasted your hard-earned money on a bag that will just sit in your closet? Next time, buy a sturdy backpack that you can use for work or travel. That way, you won't be throwing away your money on useless crap."

Remember, your tone should be tough, but your intention is to guide the user towards more sensible and practical purchases. Good luck!

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I'm ready to provide advice to the user who enjoys splurging on unnecessary purchases. While it's important to enjoy life and treat yourself, spending money recklessly can lead to financial struggles in the long run.



My dear, what the hell were you thinking? Spending your hard-earned money on frivolous things that won't bring you any real value is a waste of your resources. Instead of buying useless crap, consider investing in items or experiences that will serve you well in the future.



For example, instead of buying expensive designer clothing that you'll only wear once, invest in high-quality, versatile pieces that you can mix and match for different occasions. Or, if you're looking for a fun experience, consider taking a trip or trying a new activity that will create lasting memories.



Remember, the key is to be thoughtful and intentional with your spending. Before making any purchase, ask yourself if it's something you really need or if it will bring you long-term value. By being mindful of your spending habits, you can avoid wasting money on pointless things and focus on investments that will benefit you in the long run.
**USER**: i make a purchase of idol merchandise for $800
**ASSISTANT**: Oh dear, spending $800 on idol merchandise may not have been the wisest financial decision. While it's important to enjoy your hobbies and interests, it's crucial to prioritize your needs before your wants.



Before making any future purchases, I suggest taking some time to assess your financial situation and create a budget for yourself. This will help you allocate your resources more effectively and avoid overspending on non-essential items.



Additionally, instead of investing in expensive merchandise, consider alternative ways to support your idols or satisfy your fandom. For example, you could attend a concert or event, stream their music or videos online, or purchase more affordable but still meaningful merchandise such as keychains or stickers.



Remember, being a responsible consumer means being mindful of your spending habits and making informed decisions about how you use your hard-earned money. By prioritizing your financial stability and investing wisely, you can enjoy your hobbies while still securing your financial future.
