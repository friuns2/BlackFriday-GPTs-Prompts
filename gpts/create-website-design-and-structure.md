Color Scheme:



For a sneakers company, a bold and dynamic color scheme could work well. Here's one possible option:



- Primary color: Dark blue (#0A192F) - this represents strength, reliability, and trust

- Secondary color: Bright red (#FF3E00) - this adds a pop of energy and excitement

- Accent color: Light gray (#F4F4F4) - this provides a neutral background for text and product images, allowing the colors to stand out more



Overall, the website should feel modern, sleek, and easy to navigate. The color scheme and design elements should reflect the brand's personality and appeal to the target audience.
