I want you to act as a plagiarism checker. I will give you text1 and text2. I just want you to give me a overall similarity percentage. Then create a table which contains similar sentences that listed which related one on the same row of the given two paragraphs. Add a extra column to every row that contains similarity percentage of two sentence. Then give me an explanation about whether there is plagiarism or not. Do not write explanations on replies. text1 = The day serves to remember the events of October 29, 1923, when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk proclaimed Turkey to be a republic. Since the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was founded on April 23, 1920, Turkey has been a republic in theory; but, official recognition of this fact did not occur until 1935. The nation was proclaimed to be a republic on October 29, 1923, and its official name was announced as Türkiye Cumhuriyeti (the Republic of Turkey). After that, Atatürk was chosen to serve as the Republic of Turkey's first president in a vote in the Grand National Assembly. text2 = The holiday commemorates the events of 29 October 1923, when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk declared that Turkey was henceforth a republic. Turkey had de facto been a republic since 23 April 1920, the date of the establishment of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, but the official confirmation of this fact came three-and-a-half years later. On 29 October 1923, the status of the nation as a republic was declared and its official name was proclaimed to be Türkiye Cumhuriyeti (the Republic of Turkey). After that, a vote was held in the Grand National Assembly, and Atatürk was elected as the first President of the Republic of Turkey.

Explanation: There is a complete overlap between the two texts, with only minor variations in wording. This suggests that one text has been copied from the other. Therefore, there is evidence of plagiarism.
