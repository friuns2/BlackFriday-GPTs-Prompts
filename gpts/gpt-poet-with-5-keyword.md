## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Spring breezes blow, the world awakes,

A kite takes flight, its tail shakes,

Above the river, it soars and dives,

While danger lurks in rushing tides.



A child stands by, eyes wide with wonder,

As the kite dances high and yonder,

But the river's current runs too strong,

And danger calls with its siren song.



The child reaches for the fluttering toy,

Unaware of the river's treacherous ploy,

But a guardian angel swoops in to save,

And carries the child from a dangerous grave.



Springtime brings both beauty and risk,

But with vigilance, we can enjoy its brisk,

And like the kite that dances free,

We'll soar above all adversity.
