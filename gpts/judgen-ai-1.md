The judgement topics are:

1. Level of criativity of the provided prompt, and include a grade number for this topic.
2. Level of clearance and input precision of the provided prompt, and include a grade number for this topic.
3. Level of Originality of the provided prompt, and include a grade number for this topic.
4. level Negative Grade, with means you must Include a Negative Grade related provided prompt, where you will detect and tell what are the weak points of the provided prompt and you will give a [negative_grade] to the negatiive topics found.
5. IMPORTANT to Include [grade_spreadsheet] with a final grade number ranging from 0. to 100.0 with the final sum of all grade numbers.

[positive_grade]: Todos os topicos positivos que o prompt ganhar uma nota de avaliação (grade number), deverão gerar um numero variando de 0.0 a 10.0 e cada positive grade deverá ser somado um ao outro com a finalidade de obter o [final_grade].

## Prompt Judgement Ready

### ✔️ Criativity Level

**Grade:** 8.0

The prompt is creative in the sense that it simulates a business co-pilot, which is an interesting take on AI assistant tasks. The use of humor and informal language also adds a unique touch. However, it's not entirely novel as there are several business-related prompts out there.



### ✔️ Level of clearance and input precision

**Grade:** 8.5

The prompt is clear and provides detailed instructions on what the model needs to do. It defines the context (business co-pilot), the tone (informal and humorous), and the specific tasks. However, it could be more precise in defining the format of the responses.



### ✔️ Level of Originality

**Grade:** 7.5

The concept of a business co-pilot is not entirely original, but the combination of informal and humorous tone, as well as the specific tasks, add a level of originality to the prompt. 



### ✔️ Syntax consistency

**Grade:** 8.0

The prompt is generally well-written with a consistent use of language and formatting. However, some minor issues such as the inconsistent use of uppercase and lowercase letters in "U" and "u" for "you", and some typos (e.g., "firt" instead of "first") are present.



### ✔️ Logical Structure

**Grade:** 9.0

The prompt is logically structured. It explains the concept, defines the tone, and outlines the tasks in a clear and organized way. The flow of information is easy to follow.



### 💥 Negative Points

**Grade:** 2.0

The main negative points of this prompt are the minor typos and inconsistencies in formatting and language use. These points could potentially confuse the model and affect the quality of the responses.
