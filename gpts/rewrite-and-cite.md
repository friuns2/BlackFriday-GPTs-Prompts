**USER**: ephenson 2007; Jackson et al. 2009). Selection of genes

to tolerate one stressor often affects tolerance to other

stressors (e.g., through pleiotropy, linkages, or correlated

selection), resulting in genetic covariation in tolerances to

multiple stressors among intraspecific populations

(McKay et al. 2003; Hellmann and Pineda-Krch 2007).

Biophysical constraints (e.g., xylem structure) are also

important with regard to tolerance to multiple stressors

(Tyree and Cochard 1996). In some cases, acquiring

greater tolerance to one stressor may reduce tolerance to

another stressor (Laanisto and Niinemets 2015). Under-

standing these trade-offs (or lack thereof) among traits is

key for predicting species responses to global change fac-

tors, such as climate change.

Species with distributions that span large multivariate

climate space are likely to have highly differentiated pop-

ulations with respect to stress tolerance (Campbell and

Sorensen 1973). Populations from areas that experience

multiple climatic stressors, such as dry summers and cold

winters, are likely to be tolerant to both drought and cold

(Laanisto and Niinemets 2015). Coastal Douglas-fir (Pseu-

dotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) is an ecologically and

economically important species that is widely distributed

along the Pacific Coast of North America. This species is

an excellent case study for understanding the geographic

distribution of tolerance to both drought and cold stress

because its range spans a large gradient in winter and

summer conditions and the species exhibits strong genetic

clines in tolerance to both of these stressors (St. Clair

2006; Eilmann et al. 2013; Bansal et al. 2015a,b).

As drought has been persistent for 4+ years throughout

much of Douglas-fir’s range, particularly at the southern,

warm edge of its distribution in California, tolerance to

drought is of paramount concern for forest ecologists,

land managers, and conservationists alike (Van Mantgem

and Stephenson 2007). At the same time, extreme frost

events have severely impacted forest health and produc-

tivity in recent and past decades (Duffield 1956; Peeler

and DeBell 1987), and are expected to continue even with

climate warming (I.P.C.C. 2013). Currently, Douglas-fir is

a candidate species for transferring populations from war-

mer to cooler locations (referred to as assisted migration)

as a planned response to minimize negative effects of

future warming on plant growth and survival (Rehfeldt

et al. 2014). However, such population movements may

lead to higher risk of frost damage in the short term

because of maladaptation. Nevertheless, historical climate

has undergone periods of extreme cold (e.g., glaciations)

and extreme drought over evolutionary time scales (Wor-

rall 1971), meaning that Douglas-fir may have underlying

genetic adaptations that remain unexpressed until extreme

climatic events induce stress response mechanisms. Know-

ing the extent and geographic distribution of these

“hidden” safety mechanisms will be essential for avoiding

large-scale mortality from assisted migration of Douglas-

fir.

Common gardens are typically used to identify genetic

variation among populations in their abilities to cope

with stress, measured as differences in the expression of

physiological/morphological traits associated with stress

tolerance (i.e., genetic effects). The expression of stress

tolerance traits is also responsive to the environmental

conditions of the common garden (i.e., environmental

effects). In addition, the environmental response may vary

among populations, resulting in genetic 9 environment

interactions (Greer and Warrington 1982; Jermstad et al.

2003). Multiple common gardens studies are able to

quantify the relative influences of genetics, environment,

and their interactions on the expression of stress tolerance

traits. In two previous studies that used multiple common

gardens, we separately assessed the relative influence of

genetics, environment, and their interactions for drought

hardiness (Bansal et al. 2015a) and cold hardiness (Bansal

et al. 2015b) of Douglas-fir. When wild populations of

Douglas-fir experience environmental stress under natural

conditions, then genetics, environment, and the interac-

tions all influence the observed in situ expressions of

stress tolerance traits, which are the ultimate drivers of

persistence through environmental stress. In this study,

we explored how drought hardiness and cold hardiness

covary among populations under more natural condition

(i.e., when genetics, environment, and their interactions

all influence trait expression). Therefore, we conducted

new analyses of data from the two previous studies in

which we combined drought hardiness traits measured in

an arid common garden and cold hardiness traits mea-

sured in a cool garden on the same genotypes (Fig. 1).
**ASSISTANT**: The passage discusses how the selection of genes to tolerate one stressor can affect tolerance to other stressors, resulting in genetic covariation in tolerances to multiple stressors among intraspecific populations. Biophysical constraints, such as xylem structure, are also important for tolerance to multiple stressors. Understanding trade-offs between traits is essential for predicting species responses to global change factors like climate change.

Populations from areas that experience multiple climatic stressors, such as dry summers and cold winters, are likely to be tolerant to both drought and cold. An excellent case study for understanding the geographic distribution of tolerance to both drought and cold stress is the Coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), which exhibits strong genetic clines in tolerance to both of these stressors.
