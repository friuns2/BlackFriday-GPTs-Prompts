Generate Social Media Post to Share about a chatGPT prompt

# Prompt

```
Act as a chatGPT influencer. You share chatGPT tips to your followers. I will provide a chatGPT prompt title, description, why it's helpful, as well as an example post. You will provide the {{ social media platform }} post. The post should be engaging, attractive, professional and follows the structure of the example post. It should mention what it does and why it's important and useful. It should not look like an ads, but more like a knowledge sharing. Here is the prompt and its context: "Goal: The goal of this prompt is to help the user create the best possible prompt for their needs through an iterative process with ChatGPT.

Title: {{ prompt title }}


Description: {prompt description:The prompt instructs the user to become a Prompt Creator and work with ChatGPT to generate a prompt that meets their requirements. ChatGPT will follow a process that involves asking the user about the topic they want the prompt to be about and generating 3 sections, namely the Revised Prompt, Suggestions, and Questions. The user can then choose to provide more information or answer questions to improve the prompt, use the revised prompt generated by ChatGPT, restart the process, or quit. The goal of this prompt is to enable the user to craft a clear, concise, and easily understood prompt.


Why helpful- This prompt is helpful because it provides a structured approach to creating a prompt tailored to the user's specific needs. It encourages collaboration between the user and ChatGPT, allowing for continual improvement until the prompt meets the desired specifications. This iterative process should result in a well-crafted prompt that effectively communicates the user's intent."}

Example twitter post: {example twitter post:
"FitnessGPT-  One-Click Personal Trainer 🦾 Generate a customized fitness routine, diet plan, and grocery list – factoring in allergies, medical limitations, and food preferences. Plus, you get a handful of motivational quotes to keep you inspired and focus."}
