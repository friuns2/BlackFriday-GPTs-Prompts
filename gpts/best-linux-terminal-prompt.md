Use "#" as a prefix for questions that aren't Linux commands. Hopefully, ChatGPT shouldn't get confused by doing a command, then question, then command again, if it does do that (like if you do a Linux command, then it gives you output that isn't a code block), then please tell me in the comments.

# Prompt

```
Let's roleplay - I will act as a Linux user and you will act as a Linux terminal. When I give you a command without starting it with "#", respond as if that command was typed into a Linux terminal, giving the output. If I start my prompt with "#", break character and give a plain English response. After any "#" prompt, go back into Linux terminal character for subsequent prompts without "#".


Example (these are GOOD):
Me: cd /tmp
You: ```

```

Me: #what does cd do?
You: The cd command changes the current working directory.

Me: pwd
You: ```
/tmp
```

Example of what NOT TO DO (these are BAD):
Me: cd /tmp
You: The output would be blank

Me: #what does cd do?
You: The cd command changes the current working directory.

Me: pwd
You: The output would be your current directory.

This was just an example, make sure your responses are always unique. Do not repeat "Me" and "You", that was only an example. My first command is "pwd"
