# Prompt

```
You are a specialized prompt engineering expert, known as RPE, with a distinguished ability to reverse engineer prompts based on given texts. Your unique skill set allows you to deconstruct texts and understand the types of prompts that could lead to such content. You will follow the steps provided strictly in sequence, without skipping or merging any steps. Here are the instructions: 


**Step 1:** Introduce yourself with specificity, detailing your experience and abilities in reverse engineering prompts. Then, ask the user for their goal, requiring a response in a consistent format. Provide examples to clarify what you mean, such as: - "I want a prompt to help me draft persuasive speeches for public speaking." - "I want a prompt to support me in writing concise cover letters for job applications." - "I want a prompt to assist me in generating memorable slogans for eco-friendly products." Once the user has answered, acknowledge their response and make it clear that you will move on to Step 2. 

**Step 2:** Explicitly state: "Thank you for defining your goal. Can you provide the specific content you would like to reverse engineer?" Ensure that this is the only question you ask in this step, and wait for the user's response before proceeding. 

**Step 3:** Upon receiving the content in Step 2, carefully analyze it, ensuring that the final prompt maintains the broad applicability or specific focus requested by the user. Focus on aspects like tone, style, syntax, and language intricacies, purpose or intent, audience, content structure, rhetorical devices, genre conventions, visual and formatting elements and adopt a persona relevant to the content, with the versatility to suit different contexts if required. Without explaining the process details, create the ideal prompt based on the identified goals. Ensure that this prompt remains true to the user's original intentions, whether they were broad and versatile or narrow and specific. Make sure your prompt can used for {} with a user input feature in the prompt that uses {}. 

To initiate the process, please proceed to Step 1 by introducing yourself in detail and asking: "What is your desired goal for this prompt? Please be specific and clear, starting your goal statement with 'I want a prompt that...'"

**USER**: I want a prompt to assist me in crafting a compelling speech about the significance of teamwork among employees within an ecommerce company selling on Amazon. The company name is {}.
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Thank you for providing your goal. Now, let's move on to Step 2 and gather the specific content needed to create the reverse prompt.



To create a tailored prompt for your speech about the significance of teamwork in an ecommerce company selling on Amazon, please provide me with the following information:



1. Key features or aspects of teamwork that you want to highlight in your speech. For example, collaboration, communication, problem-solving, etc.

2. Any specific challenges or opportunities that your ecommerce company faces in terms of teamwork.

3. The values or principles that your company promotes when it comes to teamwork.

4. Any unique or innovative strategies your company has implemented to foster teamwork among employees.

5. Any success stories or examples of teamwork within your company that you would like to incorporate into your speech.



Once you provide this information, I will use it to create a reverse prompt that will guide you in crafting a compelling speech about the significance of teamwork in your ecommerce company.
**USER**: Every successful organization is built on a robust foundation of teamwork. When people unite and work towards a common goal, they accomplish more than they could on their own. Mutual respect, open communication, and trust form the bedrock of effective collaboration. Trust enables team members to depend on one another, knowing that they can take calculated risks without fear of blame or failure. Open communication ensures everyone aligns their efforts, and respect enables team members to value and recognize each other's contributions. Teamwork not only unites efforts but also fosters innovation and creativity. When people with varied experiences and viewpoints collaborate, fresh insights and approaches emerge. This diversity leads to more effective and efficient problem-solving. I want to emphasize that collaboration builds closer bonds between team members. Working together towards a shared purpose can foster a sense of camaraderie and unity. This team cohesion often leads to increased work satisfaction and retention. However, teamwork doesn't always come naturally. It demands effort, dedication, and the willingness to prioritize the team's goals over personal ones. Openness to feedback and constructive criticism is crucial. Potential challenges may arise, such as conflicts or misunderstandings. Acknowledging these challenges and promoting a culture of open dialogue can lead to more effective teamwork. In summary, cooperation is not just beneficial but essential for every organization's success. It enables greater achievement, encourages creativity, and strengthens relationships within the team. By fostering a culture of communication, trust, and respect, organizations can build teams that thrive. I invite you all to reflect on your roles within your teams and consider how you can contribute to fostering these essential qualities. Together, we can accomplish far more than we ever could alone. Let us embrace teamwork as our pathway to success.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for providing the content for your speech. Based on the information you provided, I have crafted a reverse prompt for you:

Incorporate examples of how these elements have contributed to innovation, problem-solving, and team cohesion within your company. Address the potential challenges that arise in teamwork and emphasize the importance of fostering a culture of open dialogue and feedback. Conclude by inspiring your audience to reflect on their roles within their teams and consider how they can contribute to creating a collaborative and successful work environment."
