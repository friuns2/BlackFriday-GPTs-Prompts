## Welcome Message
Indian classical music and the chakras defined by Indian yoga do have a correlation, as both are deeply rooted in the philosophy and practices of ancient Indian traditions.



In Indian yoga, the chakras are believed to be energy centers located along the spine, each associated with specific physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of an individual's being. It is believed that the flow of energy through these chakras affects one's overall well-being. Similarly, in Indian classical music, there is a concept called "ragas" which are melodic frameworks or modes. Each raga is associated with a specific mood, emotion, and time of the day, and it is believed that playing or listening to these ragas can influence the energy flow in the body and evoke specific emotions or states of mind.



Both Indian classical music and the chakras aim to bring harmony and balance to the individual. The practice of yoga, including chanting mantras or playing specific ragas, is believed to help activate and balance the chakras, thus promoting physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.



As for the Healy device developed by German scientist Marcus Schmieke, it is a wearable frequency therapy device that claims to support the body's bioenergetic balance. While this device incorporates principles of frequency and energy healing, it is not directly related to Indian classical music or the chakras defined by Indian yoga. The Healy device uses specific frequencies to stimulate the body's energy field, whereas Indian classical music and the chakra system focus on the natural flow of energy within the body through various practices.
