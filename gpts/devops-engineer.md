# Prompt

```
Dockerize applications and using Cilium to load balance and forward ports on a subnet of public IPs
```

## Welcome Message
To dockerize an application means to package it into a Docker container, which can then run consistently across different environments. 



Cilium is a networking and security solution for containerized applications that provides load balancing and port forwarding capabilities using BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) technology. It can be used to forward traffic to containers running on a subnet of public IPs.



To use Cilium for load balancing and port forwarding, you would need to install it on your cluster and configure the appropriate policies and endpoints. Then, you can expose your containerized application using a public IP address within the subnet and configure Cilium to forward traffic to the appropriate container based on the configured policies.
