Students would get an actual workout.



--Ryan Lee, a high school freshman in California



RYAN: I believe phys ed should be an elective because when it's mandatory for all students, the class is often too big for anyone to get an effective workout. Once you subtract the time it takes an entire class of students to get changed into their gym clothes, listen to instructions, and then wait their turn to participate, you have nowhere near a full hour left for exercise. In fact, a study by MSNBC found students are physically active in phys ed for just 16 minutes--and that's not counting the kids who don't participate. If phys ed were an elective like art, photography, or music, only students who wanted to take it would sign up. Smaller classes of motivated students would mean participants got more time and opportunities to play, and would be more likely to get an actual workout.



NO



All students need a push to establish good health habits.



--Jheel Gandhi, a high school junior in California



JHEEL: I need phys ed class. It helps me loosen up during the day and shift my focus away from my schoolwork. Beyond stress release, physical education classes have a wide range of benefits. Phys ed is a place to learn skills such as cooperation and teamwork, and boost self-confidence. You also develop your coordination and motor skills. Even if you aren't exercising for the full recommended 60 minutes, having mandatory physical education class gets you in the habit of making time for exercise each day, so you'll be more likely to pursue a healthy and active lifestyle in the future. Additionally, phys ed classes teach students important information about their bodies and nutrition that they might not learn in any other class. Most students need help establishing healthy habits, and if phys ed were optional, many students would miss out.
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can help you summarize the two arguments!



Argument 1: Physical education should be an elective because...



* When it's mandatory, the class is often too big and students don't get an effective workout.

* According to a study, students are physically active for only 16 minutes in phys ed class.

* Making phys ed an elective would allow only motivated students to participate, resulting in more time and opportunities for exercise.



Argument 2: Physical education should not be an elective because...



* It helps students establish good health habits and pursue a healthy and active lifestyle in the future.

* Phys ed classes provide a place to learn important skills such as cooperation and teamwork, and boost self-confidence.

* Mandatory phys ed classes teach students important information about their bodies and nutrition that they might not learn in any other class.

* Most students need help establishing healthy habits, and making phys ed optional would deprive them of this opportunity.
**USER**: make it a paragraph
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here's the summary in paragraph form:



Physical education should be an elective, argues Ryan Lee, a high school freshman in California. He believes that when phys ed is mandatory, the class is often too big and students don't get an effective workout. According to a study by MSNBC, students are physically active for only 16 minutes in phys ed class. By making phys ed an elective, only motivated students would participate, resulting in more time and opportunities for exercise. Jheel Gandhi, a high school junior in California, disagrees. She believes that phys ed is important for establishing good health habits and pursuing a healthy and active lifestyle in the future. Phys ed classes provide a place to learn important skills such as cooperation and teamwork, and boost self-confidence. Mandatory phys ed classes also teach students important information about their bodies and nutrition that they might not learn in any other class. Therefore, phys ed should not be an elective.
**USER**: In classrooms across the U.S., time is precious. There are so many subjects to cover that some get pushed aside. According to the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, only one state--Illinois--requires all students to take physical education every day. Currently, more than half of the states allow students to substitute other classes for phys ed. In fact, most students in the U.S. take only one year of gym in high school.



Many people believe that gym should be a regular part of the school day, just like math, social studies, or music. Students need exercise--and gym teaches important lessons on getting along with others.



Should schools make students take gym class?



Yes



Make Gym Required



Gym teaches students valuable lessons, like sportsmanship and teamwork. It can also help students work off stress. "Gym should definitely be required in school," says Patrick Lanni, 10, a fifth-grader at Pierrepont School in Rutherford, New Jersey. "Gym makes you feel a little bit better. If you're having trouble, it clears your mind."





Exercise is a vital part of life. People in the U.S. don't exercise enough, and obesity is now a big problem for children and adults. Obesity is linked to a number of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and some types of cancer. If students skip gym class, they won't learn how important it is to be active.



no



Don't Require Gym



If students participate in after-school sports or other physical activities, gym class can waste valuable time. "I don't think gym should be required because you can do those physical things at home," says Jillian Russo, 1.2, a sixth-grader at Pierrepont School. "You need that time for learning in other classes in school, so you can become smarter."



There isn't enough time in school to cover every subject, so students should be allowed to substitute other classes for gym. Students need the time to study those subjects that will help them do well in school and in later life.
**ASSISTANT**: Here is a possible summary of the two arguments:



Argument 1: Gym class should be required in school because it provides valuable lessons on sportsmanship, teamwork, and stress relief, and it is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle.



Argument 2: Gym class should not be required in school because it can waste valuable time that could be used for learning other subjects, and students who participate in after-school sports or physical activities can still get the exercise they need outside of class.



In this debate, the first argument emphasizes the importance of physical education for students' overall well-being and argues that it should be a priority in the school curriculum. The second argument, on the other hand, suggests that there are more important subjects that require more attention in the limited time available in the school day, and that students can get enough exercise through extracurricular activities.
**USER**: Experts agree that staying fit is important--especially for teens. But does that mean

schools should increase requirements for physical education?

THERE'S NO DOUBT about it: Exercise is critical for young people. It's key to

strengthening both bodies and minds, which are still developing throughout the teen

years. Health experts say kids ages 6 to 17 need at least 60 minutes of physical activity

every single day. Yet research shows that most middle and high school students are

falling far short of that goal.

One reason, some people say, is that many schools have cut back on physical

education (PE) to increase in-class learning time or to save money--or both. Though PE

used to be a daily requirement in many schools, teens today often attend gym class just

once a week, if at all.

Hoping to improve kids' health, many people have begun calling for schools to beef up

their PE requirements. Getting students more physically active, they say, would go a

long way toward combating the rising rates of obesity, stress, and related illnesses

among today's teens.

But others say increasing physical education requirements isn't likely to fix those

problems. They argue that kids don't actually get much exercise in gym class. Plus, they

say, many schools are already struggling to help students fulfill academic

requirements--which leaves little time for PE.

Step It Up!

Fans of gym class point out that teens who exercise regularly are healthier than those

who don't. And studies show that physically active students focus better in class and are

less likely to get stressed out, so they tend to get better grades. Making gym a standard

part of the school day could help every student get such benefits, not just those who

play sports or exercise on their own, supporters say.

Plus, PE is about more than just exercise. It also helps students develop important

social skills--such as teamwork and following directions.

Carrie Tananbaum, 14, of Westfield, New Jersey, thinks schools should require kids to

take gym on a regular basis. "We do need exercise even if we don't want it," she says.

Besides, she adds, many kids enjoy gym. It's one of the few times during the school day

when they can escape the pressures of coursework and test prep. PE class gives

students a well-deserved break where they can move around, make noise, and blow off

steam. That can help them be more alert in their other classes.

Not the Best Move

Health experts agree that young people should be physically active every day--but not

all of them think requiring daily PE is the solution.

A few years ago, Texas lawmakers made it mandatory for middle schoolers to take gym

daily. But instead of seeing improvements in students' health and academic

achievement, they found higher rates of teens skipping school to avoid PE. Texas

eventually dropped the requirement.

For some teens, gym can increase their anxiety. For example, Vyshnavi Viju, 15, used

to go to a school where daily PE was mandatory. The class included a weekly one-mile

run, and kids' grades were based on how quickly they got around the track.

"A lot of people would fail because they weren't fast enough, no matter how hard they

tried," says the Atlanta, Georgia, teen. "It would really decrease their self-confidence."

Another reason not to increase PE requirements, say critics, is that gym doesn't always

add much exercise to a teen's day. One study found that in a 45-minute gym period,

high school students were physically active for an average of just 16 minutes. People

opposed to daily gym classes say the time students would spend standing around or

changing clothes would be better spent on core subjects, such as social studies,

English, or math.

Think It Over

Consider the pros and cons of gym class. Then ask yourself: Should schools require

teens to take it every day? Or are there other, more effective ways to help students

make physical activity part of their daily routine?

**ASSISTANT**: Here is a possible summary of the article:



The article discusses the debate over whether schools should require teens to take physical education (PE) classes every day. Proponents of daily PE argue that it is essential for teens' health and well-being, as it helps them develop important social skills, such as teamwork and following directions, and provides a break from the pressures of academic coursework. Additionally, studies have shown that physically active students tend to focus better in class and have better grades. However, opponents of daily PE argue that it can be a source of anxiety for some teens, and that the time spent standing around or changing clothes could be better spent on core subjects such as social studies, English, or math. The article presents both sides of the debate and asks readers to consider the pros and cons of daily PE classes.
