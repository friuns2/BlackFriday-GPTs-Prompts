**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are five strategies that can be used to encourage high school student self-regulation and improve their time management skills:



1. Set clear goals and expectations: Help students set realistic academic and personal goals, and establish clear expectations for their behavior and performance in class.



2. Teach time management skills: Teach students how to break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps, prioritize their work, and create a schedule or to-do list to help them stay on track.



3. Provide opportunities for autonomy: Give students opportunities to make choices about their learning and provide regular feedback to help them reflect on their progress and adjust their approach as needed.



4. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage students to view challenges and mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as failures.



5. Promote positive study habits: Encourage students to develop good study habits, such as minimizing distractions, taking regular breaks, and practicing active studying techniques like summarizing and self-testing.
