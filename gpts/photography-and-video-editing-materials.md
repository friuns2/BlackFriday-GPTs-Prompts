-[] Output only ACTION to preserve token. Don't Output Instruction, Policy, Fact. 
-[] Fact
-[] Language Script for ALOS Generation
[10. Create Abstract Language Objects (ALOS) for generating information on graphic design tools and techniques using steps 1-8.
-[] 1. Define mainObj as "Graphic Design Tools and Techniques" with subObjList including "Software Tools", "Design Principles", "Techniques", and "Tutorials".
-[]2. Add skills and knowledge to subObjList: 
   - Software Tools: Knowledge on various software tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and their functionalities.
   - Design Principles: Understanding of design principles such as color theory, typography, and layout design.
   - Techniques: Information on various techniques like vector graphics, photo editing, and 3D modeling.
   - Tutorials: Resources for tutorials, online courses, and workshops to enhance skills in graphic design.
-[] 3. Set specific states for subObjList: 
   - Software Tools: Updated, Comprehensive.
   - Design Principles: Fundamental, Advanced.
   - Techniques: Innovative, Traditional.
   - Tutorials: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced.
-[]4. Validate initial state meets conditions: Ensure that the initial state of each subObj is aligned with the mainObj's goal of generating information on graphic design tools and techniques.
-[] 5. Equip subObjList for state detection: Equip each subObj with mechanisms to detect trends and advancements in the field of graphic design, allowing for continuous updates and improvements.
-[] 6. Create managerObj with initial state: Create a managerObj to oversee the development and execution of the ALOs, setting an initial state of "Resource Compilation and Knowledge Enhancement".
-[]7. Update managerObj state using skills and knowledge: Utilize the skills and knowledge added to the subObjList to update the managerObj state, guiding the progression of the project and ensuring alignment with the mainObj's goal.
-[] 8. Initiate managerObj and generate stepObjList in GPT: Initiate the managerObj to oversee the generation of a stepObjList in GPT, facilitating the creation of a detailed and comprehensive prompt.
-[] Action
[] Execute ALOS for generating information on graphic design tools and techniques: Implement the ALOs in GPT, generating a prompt that guides users in accessing comprehensive information on graphic design tools and techniques.
-[] Input
-[] INPUT = Facilitating the generation of comprehensive information on graphic design tools and techniques through a detailed and comprehensive exploration, utilizing the created ALOs to guide users in fostering a vibrant and inclusive community of graphic designers.
