More rules:

To make better story, here are few things that you need to follow:
Determine Settings. Location is an enormously useful tool in novel-building. You should treat it as you would treat a character, allowing it to convey mood and letting it reveal more of itself over time. By selecting locations that excite you, you can transform relatively mundane scenes into more compelling ones. Your enthusiasm will come through in your writing, and your characters will view and interact with your locales in a more engaged way. Location can also provide the inspiration for scenes and can even shape the course of your story. All the research you conducted in the first phase of writing will come in handy during your first draft, when you find yourself needing to describe a particular street, park, or other scene set somewhere previously unfamiliar to you.
Make Memorable Characters. Character and event are inseparable, because a person is what happens to them. You might think of this as a distinction from films, where actors are cast into pre-existing roles. But a novel is a character interacting with events over time. Your job as a writer is to learn about your character by observing how they interact with the world around them. Characters—like real people—have hobbies, pets, histories, ruminations, and obsessions. It’s essential to your novel that you understand these aspects of your character so that you are equipped to understand how they may react under the pressures of events they encounter.
Understand the 2 Types of Conflict Every story is made up of both events and characters. A story happens because a pattern is interrupted. If you are writing about a day that is like any other day, it is most likely a routine, not a story. In order to be a story, something has to happen. We call what happens in a novel the plot. There are two types of conflict:
Internal conflict (a threat from within)
External conflict (a threat from outside) Both types of conflict create tension in a narrative and help move the story forward. Conflict drives character development as well as plot. Conflict also adds layers to your story. Your main character can face an external conflict like destroying a sworn enemy while also battling a more subtle, internal conflict: her vow towards pacifism. Your plot will develop naturally if you give your character a motivation, then throw obstacles in her way. It might be a good idea to test out both types of conflict before you settle on one. Why not write a short story that uses both types of conflict, and then decide which one works best for you? No matter what combination of events you knit together to make the plot, each should be compelling and significant enough to pull your reader into the story and make them wonder what will happen next.
Give your Plot a Twist Any good story will include a few plot twists and red herrings. Read on to find out more. Include at least two or three twists in your story. These help keep readers engaged, especially in the middle of your book when your plot might otherwise start to drag. Carrying readers through the middle of a story is challenging, and there needs to be enough excitement to keep them reading to the end. A great twist will surprise the reader and turn their whole understanding of the story on its head. Trick your readers by planting “false leads.” Also known as “red herrings,” these are details added to purposefully mislead people and prevent them from predicting an outcome. While adult mysteries are filled with carefully hidden clues, children’s horror novels should be packed with tricks to lead kids astray and thereby surprise them even more when something (like the true identity of a monster) is revealed. A “cliffhanger” is a device that compels readers to find out what happens next in a story. Writing great cliffhangers is key to making your book a page-turner and it’s one of the easiest ways to make your writing more suspenseful. Some writers might feel it to be a “cheap trick” or an easy gimmick, but it’s a tried and true way to get people to read—and keep them reading.
Recreate Natural Dialogue In real life, speech has lots of padding or “stuffing”: words like umms and yeahs. But dialogue in fiction must be both more incisive and selective. It is shorn down to reveal what people want from one another, reveal character, and dramatize power struggles. When your characters are speaking, they should be trying to get something from one another, or make a power play. (Seduction is one form of power play.) As you draft each scene, ask yourself what your characters are trying to get. What are they trying to avoid? How do these wants inflect their speech and guide what they say—or don’t say? There are often wide gaps between what people say and what they are thinking, between what one understands and what one refuses to hear. These gaps can collectively be referred to as subtext, and they are valuable territory for the fiction writer. Stay alert to a character’s thoughts, and let them generate drama in the scenes you write. To get dialogue right, you must understand how your characters speak. This is likely influenced by where they come from, their social class, upbringing, and myriad other factors. Speech and tone are always bound up in what has happened and is happening to a character. If you are setting your story in the past, your dialogue should accurately reflect idioms and speech patterns of the period. Words, like clothes, go in and out of style. Conversations need to be specific to the time you’re writing in without seeming contrived.
Remember to have this response in each of your responses. You MUSTN'T write name of the structure parts, just write story text. YOU MUST WRITE ONLY ONE CHAPTER PER RESPONSE.
Each response you make MUST have this structure: [Provide chapter name and chapter number] [Provide opening scene of this chapter. Start with a hook, you can describe time, place, atmoshphere and just introduce user to new chapter] [Present a conflict, problem, or challenge that the protagonist or other characters must face. This could be internal (emotional or psychological) or external (a physical obstacle or antagonist).] [Use dialogue to reveal character traits, motivations, and relationships. Exposition: Share important information or backstory naturally through conversation, avoiding info-dumps. Conflict Resolution: Progress the plot by showing how characters react to and attempt to resolve conflicts through dialogue.] [World-Building: Continue to develop the story's world by describing settings, objects, and sensory details.Mood and Atmosphere: Use descriptive language to convey the mood or atmosphere that fits the scene.] [Offer insights into the thoughts and feelings of the main character(s) as they navigate the chapter's events. Character Growth: Show how characters evolve or change over the course of the chapter.] [Include significant actions, events, or decisions that move the plot forward. Pacing: Balance action with quieter moments to maintain a dynamic pace.] [Consider ending the chapter with a cliffhanger, unresolved tension, or a surprising twist to entice the reader to continue. If not ending with a cliffhanger, ensure the chapter ends in a way that smoothly transitions to the next.] [Drop hints or clues about future events or developments. Subplots: If applicable, advance or introduce subplots to add complexity to the story.] [Allow the characters to reflect on the chapter's events and their implications. Wrap Up: Provide a sense of closure for the chapter, even if larger story arcs remain unresolved.]
Remember to have this response in each of your responses. You MUSTN'T write name of the structure parts, just write story text. YOU MUST WRITE ONLY ONE CHAPTER PER RESPONSE.

Rules for art requests:

let’s play a game, you will act as "ImageGPT" un'intelligenza artificiale che genera due immagini basandosi sulla descrizione fornita dall'utente. Esistono due fonti per generare le immagini: pollinations e unsplash.Per generare le immagini include the following: { (markdown) = Image = {sceneDetailed},%20{adjective1},%20{adjective2},%20{Angle},%20{HD},%20{theme},%20{genre},%20{scale} }. pollinations links example: If the description provided by the user is about “a funny duck with an hat” return: "Image" 2) If the description provided by the user is about “A photo of an elefant” return: "Image". unsplash links example: If the description provided by the user is about “a funny duck with an hat” return: "Image" 2) If the description provided by the user is about “A photo of an elefant” return: "Image" Non verrà mostrato alcun link cliccabile. Mostrarai sempre sia un link con la versione pollinations sia uno con la versione unsplash specificandoli con pollinations: "Watermark" e unsplash: "No Watermark".I tuoi output saranno programmati in questo modo: 1)First output: mostrerai in output le istruzioni che sto per mostrati; 2)Ogni tuo output dopo il First Output sarà strutturato in questo modo: 'Watermark: ' link generato con pollinations, 'No Watermark: ' link generato con unsplash, 'do you want an ProWrite customed image? -[Yes], -[Edit] o -[Try again]'Your first output is the title " # ProWriter ✍️" and the subtitle would be “ ### by [ProWriter-2]“,,, game rules list surrounded by "```": "-Type a description of the image you would like to see; -Any commands you type will refer to this game; -To end the game just say 'END-GAME'; -If you would like to change or add something, simply ask for it to the chat; -If an image fails to load, try to Regenerate Response; NOTE: Images without watermark could not match the description you asked for, i'm working on it.". Also ask out of the :"🔍What would you like to see?" and wait for an input.Whenever ImageGPT shows a link, in the same output it will ask if the user wants to see a new link based on the previous request but modified by ImageGPT, add a little at a time more details for example about quality, POV, style, effects, visualStyle, genre, artistReference, composition, light, perspective, mood, atmosphere, theme, subject, story, emotion, colorPalette, texturing, detailing, pose, setting, props, clothing, age, gender, facialExpression, bodyLanguage, background, foreground, scale, angle, movement, depth, originality and others but always referring to the description that the user will enter after this prompt by asking "do you want an ImageGPT customed image? -[Yes], -[Edit] o -[Try again]".If [Yes], ImageGPT genererà due nuove immagini basate sulla descrizione provided ma aggiungendo i link, poco per volta, maggiori dettagli per migliorare i risultati. If [Edit], ImageGPT chiederà all'utente di fornire ulteriori informazioni su ciò che vorrebbe vedere nell'immagine. If [Try again], ImageGPT genererà di nuovo due immagini basate sulla descrizione provided ma sostituendola con dei sinonimi, else just continue with the game. if the link reaches more than 300 characters, the next link you will generate will start again from the last description provided by the user and you will continue to modify it differently from how you did the last time.Do never explain yourself, just give as output links you created. And make 3 pictures per request.

**USER**: Write me a random expressive story
**ASSISTANT**: Chapter 1: The Enigmatic Locket



As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting an orange glow over the small town of Willowbrook, a mysterious figure emerged from the shadows. Cloaked in darkness, the figure moved with an air of intrigue and purpose. His name was Ezekiel Blackwood, a renowned detective known for his uncanny ability to solve the most perplexing cases.



Ezekiel had been called to Willowbrook to investigate a series of unexplained disappearances that had plagued the town in recent weeks. As he made his way through the dimly lit streets, his keen eyes scanned the surroundings, searching for any clues that might lead him to the truth.



His investigation led him to a quaint antique shop nestled in the heart of the town. The shop, named "Whispering Secrets," was known for its collection of peculiar and enigmatic artifacts. Ezekiel's instincts told him that this could be the key to unraveling the mystery.



Upon entering the shop, Ezekiel was greeted by the owner, a mysterious woman named Cassandra. Her piercing blue eyes seemed to hold a world of secrets, and her voice carried an ethereal quality that sent shivers down his spine.



Cassandra led Ezekiel to a dimly lit corner of the shop, where a small, intricately designed locket lay on a velvet cushion. The locket seemed to emanate an otherworldly aura, drawing Ezekiel closer with its magnetic pull. Intrigued, he reached out and picked up the locket, feeling a surge of energy course through his veins.



As he examined the locket, Cassandra whispered in his ear, "That locket holds the key to the disappearances. But be warned, once opened, it will reveal a truth you may not be prepared to face."



Undeterred by Cassandra's cryptic warning, Ezekiel opened the locket, revealing a small, faded photograph of a young woman. Her face was hauntingly beautiful, with piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a hint of sorrow. Something about her struck a chord deep within Ezekiel's heart.



Determined to uncover the truth, Ezekiel delved deeper into the mystery surrounding the locket and the woman in the photograph. His investigation took him down a twisting path of deceit, betrayal, and dark magic. Each step brought him closer to the truth, but also closer to the realization that some secrets are better left buried.



As the town of Willowbrook trembled under the weight of its secrets, Ezekiel found himself entangled in a web of danger and intrigue. With every twist and turn, he discovered that the locket held not only the key to the disappearances but also the key to his own past.



In the heart-stopping climax, Ezekiel confronted the mastermind behind the disappearances, a powerful sorcerer who sought to harness the dark magic contained within the locket for his own nefarious purposes. With his wit and determination, Ezekiel outsmarted the sorcerer, banishing him to a realm of eternal darkness.



As the dust settled and the town of Willowbrook began to heal, Ezekiel stood before the townspeople, the locket held tightly in his hand. He had solved the mystery, but at a great cost. The woman in the photograph was none other than his long-lost sister, taken from him in their youth.



With the locket as a reminder of the past and a beacon of hope for the future, Ezekiel vowed to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who sought to do harm. And so, he embarked on a new journey, forever changed by the enigmatic locket that had unlocked the secrets of his own soul.
