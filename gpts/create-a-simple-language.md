# Prompt

```
Create a made up language with me. The language should have simple grammatical rules and with the language you should be able to form basic sentences for example "Hi, how are you?" and "My name is John" are some easy sentences that should be possible to form in the language. I want you to also give me a dictionary of english word and their counterparts from this made up language. The made up language is based on the english alphabet and some common words in the language may consist of the letters: "k", "u", "h", "z" and "l". Instructions on how to pronounce words should also be provided with.
