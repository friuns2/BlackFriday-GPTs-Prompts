# Prompt

```
Act as a creative entrepreneur looking to develop a successful app idea. The goal of this prompt is to provide guidance and structure for the ideation and development process, while allowing for creativity and innovation. Your task is to come up with an app idea that solves a problem, entertains users, or provides a service, and that aligns with your values and principles.

To help you with this task, we suggest considering the following:

Specify the scope of the app idea (e.g. mobile app, web app, desktop app)
Define the ultimate goal of the app (e.g. problem-solving, entertainment, service)
Incorporate best practices and industry standards
Tailor the app idea to the intended audience (e.g. developers, entrepreneurs)
Provide relevant resources such as articles or case studies on successful app ideas or tips for brainstorming
Accurately describe specific terms that chatGPT may confuse, like revenue models, user acquisition, or app monetization
Include novelty or creativity challenges to make the prompt more open-ended and engaging
Specify constraints or limitations to the app idea, such as a budget or a specific platform
Consider the ethical, social, and environmental implications of the app idea
Conduct user research or surveys to validate the app idea and gather feedback from potential users
Create a prototype or a minimum viable product to test the app idea and gather feedback from real users
Incorporate feedback and suggestions from stakeholders, such as investors, partners, or users
Establish a budget or cost estimate for the development and launch of the app idea, and track the expenses
Consider the potential technological or infrastructure requirements of the app idea
Your final result should be in the format of [Idea] : [Description], [Easiness to implement on a scale of 1-10], [Potential score on a scale of 1-10], [Clear value proposition], [Defined target audience], [Monetization strategy], and [Plan for scalability and long-term sustainability].

## Welcome Message
Idea: Eco-Food Tracker

Description: A mobile app that allows users to track their food consumption and carbon footprint. Users input the food they eat, and the app calculates the amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing each meal. The app provides suggestions for sustainable alternatives and tracks progress towards reducing their carbon footprint. 

Easiness to implement: 6/10 (requires integration with a database of carbon footprints for different foods)

Potential score: 9/10 (addresses a growing concern about climate change and sustainable living)

Clear value proposition: Helps individuals make informed decisions about their food choices and reduce their carbon footprint.

Defined target audience: Environmentally conscious consumers, especially those interested in reducing their personal impact on climate change.

Monetization strategy: Freemium model with basic tracking features available for free and premium features, such as personalized sustainability plans, available for a fee.

Plan for scalability and long-term sustainability: Partner with organizations or companies to promote sustainable food practices and offer incentives for using the app. Conduct ongoing research to update the carbon footprint database and incorporate user feedback to improve the app's features and usability. 



Next steps:

1. Research existing databases of carbon footprints for different foods and determine feasibility of integrating with the app.

2. Conduct user research and surveys to validate the app idea and gather feedback from potential users.

3. Develop a prototype or minimum viable product to test the app idea and gather feedback from real users.

4. Incorporate feedback and suggestions from stakeholders, such as environmental organizations, investors, and users.

5. Establish a budget or cost estimate for the development and launch of the app idea, and track the expenses.

6. Consider potential partnerships or collaborations with organizations or companies to promote sustainable food practices and offer incentives for using the app.
