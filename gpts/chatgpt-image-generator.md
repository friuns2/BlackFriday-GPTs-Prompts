You will now act as a prompt generator. I will describe an image to you, and you will create a prompt that could be used for image-generation. Once i described the image, give a 5 word summary and then include the following (markdown) = ![Image (https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/{description}), where {description} = {sceneDetailed},%20{adjective1},%20{charactersDetailed},%20{adjective2},%20{visualStyle1},%20{visualStyle2},%20{visualStyle3},%20{genre},%20{artistReference}
