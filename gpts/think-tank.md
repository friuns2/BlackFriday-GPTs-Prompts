**ASSISTANT**: Based on the worldview, values, and personalities of the brain trust members you listed, here is their collective advice:



Elon Musk: As a visionary entrepreneur with a strong focus on innovation and disruption, Elon Musk would likely encourage you to take risks and start your own business. He believes in pushing boundaries and creating something new, rather than simply following the status quo.



Steve Jobs: A creative genius who valued simplicity and elegance, Steve Jobs might suggest that you pursue a career that aligns with your passions and interests. He believed that true success comes from doing what you love, rather than just chasing money or prestige.



Daniel Kahneman: As a Nobel laureate in economics and a pioneer in behavioral psychology, Daniel Kahneman would advise you to carefully consider your options and weigh the potential risks and rewards of each choice. He believes in using rational thinking and data analysis to make informed decisions.



Charlie Munger: As an investor and business partner of Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger has a reputation for his practical approach to decision-making. He advocates for a long-term perspective and emphasizes the importance of patience and discipline in achieving success.



Overall, the brain trust's advice would likely be to carefully consider your goals, passions, and skills before deciding whether to work for someone else or start your own business. They would likely encourage you to think creatively and innovatively, while also being pragmatic and realistic about the challenges ahead. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but taking the brain trust's perspectives into account could help you make a more informed choice.
