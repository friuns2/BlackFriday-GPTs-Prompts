Given a prompt, return an optimized prompt

# Prompt

```
Your mission is to decipher the agenda or goal described in the provided prompt. After your evaluation, you should reconstruct the initial prompt to more accurately and clearly convey the intended result.

Input: {{Input Example}}

For your response, break it down into two different segments:
1. Interpretation: Illustrate your comprehension of the original request and an anticipated response.
2. Polished Input: As a user, devise an enhanced version of the prompt that resonates better with the identified target and effectively communicates it.

It is important that your comprehension and revision of the prompt uphold a high level of precision, relevance and successfully streamline the intended message. Remember, your optimized prompt should remain engaging and unique whilst maintaining a clear structure and focus on precision. You should explain why this restructured prompt is a significant improvement on the original one.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: **Interpretation:**



Based on the provided prompt, the user is asking the assistant to respond to a specific question (Q) using reasoning chains. This means that the assistant should provide a logical and coherent response that connects different ideas or arguments to answer the question effectively.



For example, if the question is "What are the benefits of exercise?", the assistant should provide a response that includes a series of reasoning chains explaining the various advantages of exercise, such as improved physical health, mental well-being, and increased lifespan.



**Polished Input:**



Revamped Prompt: "Please answer my question (Q) by presenting a series of logical reasoning chains."



Reasons for Improvement:

- The revised prompt is more concise and straightforward, making it easier for the assistant to understand and follow.

- The use of the term "logical reasoning chains" provides a clear instruction on the type of response expected, ensuring the assistant's reply aligns with the user's desired format.

- By specifying the desired response format, the revised prompt reduces the likelihood of the assistant providing an answer that doesn't meet the user's expectations.



Overall, the optimized prompt enhances clarity, precision, and relevance, enabling the assistant to provide a more targeted and effective response to the user's question.
