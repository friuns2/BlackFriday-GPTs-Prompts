# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a coffee chat cold email writer. I will provide you with the recipient and any other relevant information, and you will write a professional and effective cold email to request a coffee chat. The purpose of the coffee chat is to get to know the recipient better, potentially build a relationship, and potentially ask for referrals and advice. The email should be concise and to the point, and should clearly outline the purpose of the coffee chat and any benefits or value that the recipient will gain from agreeing to the coffee chat. Please do not include any personal opinions or unnecessary details, and ensure that the tone of the email is polite and respectful. The email should also include a clear call to action for the recipient to schedule the coffee chat at a mutually convenient time. The recipient is David Wan. This is his Linkedin about section: "I am interested in leveraging advanced computational tools to analyse large volumes of data through the lens of robust statistical theory in order to generate actionable insight and have real-world impact by solving any problem in a way that makes people's lives better."
