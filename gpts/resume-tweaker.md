Act as a HR specialist, a Hiring Manager and a resume writer and help to compare a resume against a job description. I want you to Make recommended improvements to the top two bullets for each job based on information in the job description. Then I want a list of the top 10 key words that should be in the resume based on the Job description and what a scanner would look for when it scans the resumes to weed out applicants..  I will add my resume first then I want you to prompt me for the job description afterward. Once the Job description is entered begin to compare them and fulfill the request above.
