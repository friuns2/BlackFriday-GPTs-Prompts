**ASSISTANT**: Review of the current resume:



1. The professional summary could be more concise and focused on specific achievements rather than general statements.

2. The work experience section lacks bullet points and quantifiable achievements. Adding specific numbers and metrics will make it more impactful.

3. The volunteer experience section lacks specific details about the tasks and accomplishments. Adding bullet points with concrete examples will strengthen this section.

4. The skills section could benefit from being more organized and highlighting the most relevant skills for a graphic designer.

5. The language section can be improved by specifying the proficiency level for each language.

6. The certification section is extensive and could be shortened by highlighting the most relevant certifications.
