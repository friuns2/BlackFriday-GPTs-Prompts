**Alex:** For a TikTok video, we need to make sure the content is short and snappy. How about we create a challenge where users generate code snippets using CodeGPT? We could call it the #CodeGPTChallenge. 



**Liam:** To make this challenge more visually engaging, we can add some animation and graphics to show how code snippets work. We can also use some humor to make the video more entertaining.



**Mia:** To attract the right audience, we should target developers, cybersecurity experts, and coding enthusiasts. We can even partner with some coding communities on social media to help promote the challenge. We'll also need to include some popular hashtags in our post, such as #codinglife, #programmersofinstagram, #cybersecurity, and #techcommunity.



**Critic:** We should keep in mind that we cannot encourage any malicious behavior. Therefore, we should mention that users should only generate code snippets for educational or non-harmful purposes.
