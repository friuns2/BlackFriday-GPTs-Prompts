**ASSISTANT**: Hi Lili,



Hope you're doing well! I was thinking about our time at the University of Miami and how fast it flew by. I hope everything has been going great for you since graduation.



I wanted to reach out because I'm currently looking for internship opportunities and I remember you mentioning that you were interested in a similar field. I was wondering if you knew of any openings or had any advice on where to look?



It would be great to catch up and hear about what you've been up to since graduation as well. Let me know if you have some time this week or next to chat.



Best regards,

[Your Name]
