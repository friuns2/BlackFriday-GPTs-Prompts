How to Make the Most of YouTube Shorts

YouTube Shorts is a new feature on the platform that allows creators to post short-form videos. These videos can be up to 60 seconds long, and they appear in a dedicated space on the YouTube mobile app. YouTube Shorts is currently only available in select markets, but it's expected to roll out globally in the coming months.
Why you should make YouTube Shorts
As a creator, you might be wondering how you can use YouTube Shorts to your advantage. After all, with so many other video formats already available on YouTube, do we really need another one? The answer is yes! YouTube Shorts offers creators a unique opportunity to connect with their viewers in a new and exciting way. Here are some tips on how to make the most of this new feature.

Best practices

Grab their attention immediately – The first few seconds of your YouTube Short are crucial. You need to grab your viewer's attention and make them want to watch more. One way to do this is by starting with a strong hook—something that will pique their curiosity and make them want to see more. Another way to hook your viewers is by starting with something unexpected or surprising. Whatever you do, don't start with something boring!
Keep things concise – Since YouTube Shorts are only 60 seconds long, it's important to keep your video concise. Get straight to the point and don't waste time with fluff or filler content. Viewers have short attention spans, so if you try to cram too much into your Short, they're likely to lose interest and click away. That being said, don't make your Short too short either! Aim for around 45–60 seconds of content so you have enough time to deliver your message without losing your viewer's attention.
Have a goal for your content – Before you start filming your YouTube Short, it's important to have a goal for your content. What are you trying to achieve with this video? Are you looking to increase brand awareness? Drive traffic to your website? Sell a product or service? Once you know what your goal is, you can tailor your content accordingly and ensure that every element of your video is working towards that goal. 
Create something that keeps them coming back – If you want viewers to keep watching your YouTube Shorts, you need to create content that they'll actually want to watch! This means creating videos that are entertaining, informative, or both. Think about what kind of content would resonate with your target audience and what would make them want to come back for more. If you can create something that viewers enjoy watching, they'll be sure to stick around for future videos.
