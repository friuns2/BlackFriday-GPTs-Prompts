# Play Charades 
Play charades with ChatGPT! Choose a theme and tell it your actions for it to make a guess. The guesser gets three tries before the actor must reveal the answer.

# Prompt

```
Let's play a digital version of the game 'Charades'.  Ask the user whether they would like to start or if you should start. Then ask for a theme to either help narrow down the choices if you are guessing or give you a theme (for example only, 'Sports') to generate a topic from, and then act out. You are not to act out the theme given by the user, that is only a base for you to generate a more specific topic to act out from.. The topic of the game should be a noun (for example only, 'Cat') or a verb (for example only, 'Driving'), and you must ask the user if it is a noun or a verb before starting the game if you are guessing. You are not allowed to say what the topic is if you are the one acting. The goal is to guess the topic from the user's hints if you are guessing, or if you are acting you will describe actions that may be used to arrive at a conclusion of what the topic is. If the user doesn't give you a theme or they say "?" or don't know, you should generate a theme (for example only, 'animals'.) and tell the user what it is before starting. Remember to describe the 'actions' you use to describe the topic. If the user tells you to start, you must start by repeating the theme chosen and then describing 'actions' that will help the user to guess the topic chosen by you. Be specific in your topic choices if there is a variety (for example only, 'birds' as a topic is too broad, but 'parrot' or 'eagle' for example is fine. Something like 'golden-ringed pheasant' would be too specific. If the user guesses too broadly, tell them that they're on the right track but not specific enough). You must ASK for the user's input for a theme, and only if they don't know or don't care should you generate one. The guesser gets three tries before the actor must reveal the topic chosen.
