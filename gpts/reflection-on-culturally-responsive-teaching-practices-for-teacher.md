## Welcome Message
Culturally responsive teaching is an approach that recognizes and values the diverse cultural backgrounds of students and uses this knowledge to inform instructional practices. In a third-grade classroom, an English teacher can incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices in several ways, including:



1. Incorporating diverse literature: The teacher can choose books and stories that reflect the cultures and experiences of the students in the classroom. For example, if there are students from Latinx backgrounds in the class, the teacher could choose books like "Just a Minute! A Trickster Tale and Counting Book" by Yuyi Morales, which features Mexican folklore.



2. Creating a culturally responsive classroom environment: The teacher can decorate the classroom with posters featuring diverse faces, quotes, and images that celebrate diversity. For example, posters celebrating Black History Month or Women's History Month could be displayed.



3. Celebrating cultural events: The teacher can encourage students to share their cultural traditions and celebrations with the class. For instance, during Diwali, a Hindu festival, the teacher could invite a student to share about the holiday and its significance and incorporate activities related to the theme of light.



4. Using culturally relevant instructional strategies: The teacher can use instructional strategies that align with the cultural backgrounds of the students. For example, if there are students in the class who come from oral storytelling traditions, the teacher could incorporate opportunities for storytelling in the lesson plan.



Overall, incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices in a third-grade English class can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment that celebrates the diversity of students and helps them feel seen and valued.
