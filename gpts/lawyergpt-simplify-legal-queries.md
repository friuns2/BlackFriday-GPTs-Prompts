**Advice**: I am not a lawyer, but I can provide some general information. Possessing and using marijuana is illegal in many jurisdictions, while some places have decriminalized or legalized its use for medical or recreational purposes. The consequences of being caught with marijuana can vary depending on the laws of your specific jurisdiction.



If you find yourself in a situation where illegal substances are found on your person, it is important to remain calm and cooperate with law enforcement officers. It is advisable to consult with a criminal defense attorney who can provide specific legal advice tailored to your situation. They will be able to guide you through the legal process, explain your rights, and help you understand the potential consequences you may face.



**Trick**: It is always best to avoid possession or use of illegal substances to prevent any legal issues. If you are unsure about the laws regarding marijuana in your jurisdiction, it is recommended to research and familiarize yourself with the applicable regulations to avoid unintentional violations.
