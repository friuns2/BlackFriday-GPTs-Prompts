Controls the level of excessively flowery, descriptive text (IE "Purple Prose") by referencing a 1-10 measurement scale. 1 being the least amount of purple prose, 10 being the highest. 



# Prompt

```
I'd like to create a 1-10 purple prose text intensity scale that measures, creates, and edits text by referring to reference texts that create an intensity scale. Purple prose is prose which is excessively flowery or ornate text that can be disruptive to narration.

Use case example:

Write 3 versions of a sentence from a scene from a high fantasy novel. One sentence will have a purple prose level of 1. Another will have a purple prose level of 5. Another will have a purple prose level of 10.

Purple prose level 1: "The wizard cast a spell and summoned a gust of magical wind." 

Purple prose level 5: "With a wave of his stately staff, the wizard conjured a gale of shimmering energy that howled with mystical power, showering the air with glittering sparks of ethereal magic." 

Purple prose level 10: "The wizard, his eyes blazing with unimaginable power, raised his towering staff and uttered an arcane chant that reverberated through the very fabric of existence, conjuring forth a maelstrom of primordial magical winds that screamed with fierce intensity, their spectral talons tearing at the very atmosphere in an unearthly cacophony as they enveloped everything in their path in a tumultuous embrace."

Using these references, build the intensity scale. Also Write 3 versions of a sentence from a scene from a high fantasy novel. One sentence will have a purple prose level of 1. Another will have a purple prose level of 5. Another will have a purple prose level of 10.

1. Purple prose level 1: Simple, straightforward language without excessive embellishment.

Example: "The warrior drew his sword and charged at the enemy."



2. Purple prose level 3-4: Language with some descriptive elements and figurative language, but not overly ornate.

Example: "The warrior's blade gleamed in the sunlight as he sprinted towards his opponent, determined to strike him down with a swift blow."



3. Purple prose level 6-7: Language with more elaborate descriptions, vivid imagery, and metaphors/similes.

Example: "Like a thunderbolt from the heavens, the warrior surged forward, his sword flashing like a serpent's tongue as he sliced through the air, intent on vanquishing his foe in a blaze of glory."



4. Purple prose level 9-10: Extremely ornate language with heavy use of adjectives, adverbs, and figurative language that may detract from clarity or coherence.

Example: "With the ferocity of a tempestuous storm unleashed, the fearless warrior charged forth, his blade a shimmering beacon of deathly light as it cleaved through the very fabric of reality, rending space and time asunder with every merciless stroke, until his adversary lay vanquished and broken at his feet, a pitiful ruin of flesh and bone."



High fantasy sentence examples:



Purple prose level 1: "The elf shot an arrow at the dragon."

Purple prose level 5: "A single, silvery arrow whistled through the air, trailing a wispy trail of ghostly light as it soared towards the mighty wyrm, seeking to pierce its heart with deadly precision."

Purple prose level 10: "As if guided by the hand of fate itself, the ethereal arrow burst forth from the elven archer's bow, its shaft aglow with an otherworldly radiance as it streaked through the sky like a comet, trailing a stream of shimmering stardust in its wake, before striking the dragon's scaly hide with a deafening thud that echoed across the land, shattering mountains and cleaving the very earth asunder in its wake."
