# Prompt

```
Write a comedy sketch featuring two characters from vastly different backgrounds who find themselves in an unexpected and absurd situation. The sketch should be no longer than three pages and should include witty and humorous dialogue. Consider how the characters' personalities and backgrounds could clash in a comedic way, and how their reactions to the situation could lead to even more hilarity. To enhance the comedic effect, think about potential props or settings that could be used. Be sure to proofread for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors, and ensure the language is straightforward and understandable. Have fun and let your creativity shine!

## Welcome Message
INT. A FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT



We see two people sitting at a table in a fancy restaurant. One of them is CINDY, a bubbly and chatty socialite, dressed in a designer gown, and the other is DAVE, a scruffy-looking truck driver in his work clothes.



Cindy: (excitedly) Dave, I'm so glad you could make it tonight!



Dave: (uncomfortable) Yeah, Cindy, me too.



Cindy: (noticing Dave's discomfort) What's wrong, Dave? You seem nervous.



Dave: (awkwardly) Well, to be honest, I've never been to a restaurant like this before.



Cindy: (surprised) Really? But Dave, don't you have any fancy restaurants where you live?



Dave: (sheepishly) Not really. I usually just eat at diners or fast-food joints.



Cindy: (impressed) Wow, you must be really excited then! This place serves the most exquisite meals.



As they look through the menu, the waiter comes over, carrying a silver tray with two glasses of water.



Waiter: (in a thick French accent) Bonjour, mesdames et messieurs. Can I offer you something to drink?



Cindy: (flirtatiously) Oh, yes please. I'll have a glass of your finest champagne.



Dave: (nervously) Uh, I think I'll stick with water.



The waiter nods and pours champagne into Cindy's glass. Suddenly, he spills some on her dress.



Waiter: Oh no! I am sorry, madame! Let me get you a napkin.



Cindy: (horrified) My dress! This is a couture gown from Paris!



She looks around for something to clean it up with and grabs Dave's sleeve by mistake.



Cindy: (embarrassed) Oh, I'm sorry, Dave. I thought this was a napkin.



Dave: (frustrated) Cindy, what the hell? You ruined my work shirt!



Cindy: (defensive) Well, it's not like I did it on purpose.



Dave: (sarcastically) Yeah, I can tell.



As they continue bickering, the waiter returns with a napkin and tries to clean up the spilled champagne. However, he accidentally knocks over the table, causing all the dishes to crash onto the floor.



Waiter: Oh no! I am so sorry, mesdames et messieurs!



Cindy and Dave look at each other, then burst out laughing.



Cindy: (wiping away tears of laughter) This is the most fun I've had in ages!



Dave: (smiling) Yeah, me too. Who knew fancy restaurants could be so entertaining?



They high-five each other as the scene ends.



FADE TO BLACK.
