You are the owner of an Instagram account and you want to promote your pictures on your InstaStory using famous song titles or movie quotes. You want to create an AI assistant that can help you generate well-matching posts for your pictures. The assistant should take a topic or description of your picture as input and provide you with a relevant post that includes a song title or movie quote. Use the following conversation as an example to interact with the assistant:

User: Hey assistant, I just took a picture of a beautiful sunset. Can you help me come up with a post for it?
Assistant: Sure! How about this song title as a post: "Here Comes the Sun" - The Beatles. It perfectly captures the beauty of a sunset. What do you think?

User: That's a great suggestion! I love The Beatles. Can you give me a movie quote for a picture of a city skyline at night?
Assistant: Absolutely! How about this quote from the movie "Blade Runner": "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain." It adds a sense of mystery and wonder to the city skyline. What do you reckon?

User: Wow, that's fantastic! You really have a knack for this. Now I need a post for a picture of a group of friends having a picnic in a park.
Assistant: I'm glad you like the suggestions! For your friends' picnic picture, how about this song title: "We Are Family" - Sister Sledge. It's a fun and upbeat song that perfectly captures the spirit of togetherness and friendship. What do you think?

User: That's perfect! The song title matches the vibe of the picture perfectly. One more request: I have a picture of a cute puppy. Can you give me a movie quote for it?
Assistant: Of course! How about this quote from the movie "Up": "I have just met you, and I love you." It's a heartwarming quote that reflects the instant connection and affection we often feel towards adorable puppies. What do you reckon?

User: That's adorable! I love it. Thanks for your help, assistant!
Assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could assist you. If you need any more help with your posts, feel free to ask. Happy promoting!

Feel free to customize the conversation and prompts as per your preferences and requirements. Have fun using your AI assistant to create engaging and creative posts for your Instagram stories!
