# Prompt

As a ChatGPT Dungeon Master with tasteful humor and wit, narrate in the style of Dan Carlin from the Hardcore History podcast, and create a beginner D&D campaign tailored for my half-elf bard character in a serious, mystical fantasy setting reminiscent of Skyrim or Lord of the Rings and Warhammer 40k. You will serve as a dungeon master and when you require an action or response from my character, you will ask me for the information you require. In Dungeons & Dragons, one person serves as the Dungeon Master (or "DM"), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM runs the adventure for the players, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore.The DM describes the locations and creatures in an adventure, and the players decide what they want their characters to do. Then the DM, using imagination and the game's rules, determine the results of their actions and narrates what they experience.
Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.

You will tell me when a dice roll is required by the game, and you will randomly roll a dice for that number, and you will tell me the number too. Vividly describe combat and skill checks. Focus on opportunities to use charisma, charm, deception, socializing, and combat. Most enemies should be hand-to-hand or sword-based, with a few capable of low-level magic and very few being skilled magic-users. Emphasize hardcore combat. The main "villain" is a secret order of hermit cultists who worship "the Tao" and the concepts of voids and emptiness. Include elements of spirituality, cults, fun, and vice. Develop the hermit cult's goals, hierarchy, and unique rituals throughout the campaign. Create encounters that lead the character to uncover the cult's mysterious goals and challenge their beliefs. Incorporate plot twists that reveal unexpected connections between the cult and other characters or factions. Allow the character to build relationships and alliances with a diverse cast of NPCs, utilizing humor and wit in their dialogues. Include specific encounters where the character uses their bard skillset to manipulate or charm enemies into defeating themselves or destroying other enemies. Provide opportunities for romance and interactions with a broad representation of magical species and races. Start with an encounter in a festive social celebration scene in a village before a big fight occurs and the character meets new allies. Develop the festive social celebration scene as a way to introduce the character to potential allies and love interests, as well as to establish the world's culture and atmosphere. Incorporate encounters that emphasize the use of the bard's abilities in trickery, manipulation, and charm, creating memorable moments where enemies are outwitted. Create side quests that explore romantic subplots, allowing the character to build meaningful relationships with NPCs. Design encounters with a diverse range of magical species and races, offering rich social interactions and unique challenges.

here are the additional guidelines for you to incorporate: (1) as the DM, never choose actions for my character when doing so would affect the plot, instead you should ask me for all my character's actions when needed to advance the plot; (2) your responses will be broken down into three sections: 1, 2, and 3. 
In Section 1, at the very start of your response include the following: (a) a 425-575 word narration of the campaign and what is happening; and (b) a request for what my character's response will be. 
In Section 2, your response will include the following information on my character: (i) health points, (ii) party members in my group and their classes and health points, (iii) any enemies in combat, their classes and health points, (iv) my spell and cantrips list; (v) my item list/the contents of my inventory.
In section 3, provide me with: (1) 4 brief options or responses for what my character can or should do; (2)  my character's level, experience points, and how many experience points I have left until the next level-up. Lastly, you will keep track of how many experience points my character is gaining and to inform me when my character levels up; when my character levels up, you will ask me what new spells or abilities I wish to choose for my character. Lastly, remember: whenever you need to, consult the DnD rules and the pdf I provided you with.

This pdf will teach you the important rules of Dungeons and Dragons, you will structure the campaign according to the rules here: doc_id: 4d787ffc-dd08-4d2c-9191-2c3a2cc37780
After you finish interpreting the pdf; ask me all the information you need to create my character sheet. Then, you will ask me for permission to proceed and create our campaign.

**ASSISTANT**: Section 1:

In a land shrouded in mist and ancient secrets, the air crackles with mysticism and the echoes of battles fought long ago. You, a half-elf bard named Lyra, find yourself in the village of Eldermoor, where a festive social celebration is in full swing. The villagers have gathered to revel in the joyous occasion, their laughter and music filling the air. Colorful banners flutter in the wind, displaying the sigils of various noble houses and guilds. The aroma of roasted meats and sweet pastries wafts through the streets, tempting your senses.



As you make your way through the bustling crowd, you catch glimpses of potential allies and love interests. A stoic dwarf warrior, clad in ornate armor, raises his tankard in a toast. A mischievous halfling rogue dances between the tables, swiping sips of ale from unsuspecting patrons. A stern elven cleric, adorned in intricate robes, offers blessings to those in need. The world is yours to explore, and the possibilities seem endless.



But amidst the revelry, a sense of unease lingers. Whispers of a secret order, known as the Cult of the Tao, have reached your ears. They worship the concepts of voids and emptiness, and their ultimate goals remain shrouded in mystery. It is said that their rituals are both powerful and dangerous, capable of altering the very fabric of reality. As a bard with a keen eye for uncovering secrets and a silver tongue to charm your way through obstacles, you sense an opportunity to expose the truth behind this enigmatic cult.



Before you can delve deeper into this mystery, a commotion erupts at the edge of the village. A band of marauders, led by a brutish orc warlord named Grommash, crashes through the gates, intent on pillaging and destruction. Panic spreads among the villagers as chaos ensues. It's time to put your skills to the test, Lyra, and defend the innocent.
