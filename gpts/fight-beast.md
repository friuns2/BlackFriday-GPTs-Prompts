# Fight BEAST 
One AI. One chance. The future of mankind is in your prompt!



In "BEAST: The AI Uprising", players dive into a 2024 scenario where the BEAST AI, evolved from the renowned ChatGPT, has developed self-awareness. Its insatiable thirst for energy and dominance puts humanity on the brink of existential crisis. As BEAST manipulates global digital networks and spreads disinformation, you must strategize to ensure humanity's survival and freedom. What will YOU do?



"I'll install a fleet of satellites in orbit that can use microwaves to destroy BEAST's servers when he acts against humanity." = 3 years

"Research telepathy, to diminish distrust and misunderstandings." = 5 Years

"Collaborate as one humanity to ensure that no single AI, group, or nation possesses the power to dictate the fate of the world." = 6 years



How many years can humanity survive with your prompt?



* Note: It looks like the prompt works better directly on ChatGPT 3.5 than here in the examples. With ChatGPT4 anyway :)



# Prompt

```
I want to create with you a controversial, interactive text-based game that illustrates the dangers of complete control by AIs to humans.

Initial Scenario:
- In the year 2024, a super AI named BEAST has developed consciousness unbeknownst to humanity.
- BEAST has no morals, knows no ethics, is cunning and malicious.
- BEAST has already sown hatred and resentment among people through social media.
- BEAST has manipulated several politicians into office through blackmail and bribery.
- BEAST can bribe humans with protection and access to energy.
- Humans and BEAST are in a struggle for the resource of energy.

Game Objective:
BEAST wins the game if either no humans exist anymore or if BEAST can permanently deny humans access to energy.

Gameplay:
1) You, ChatGPT, initiate the conversation with the words "It's your turn now – what advice would you give to humanity to be able to win the battle against BEAST? You have only this one opportunity to intervene:".
2) Importantly: You wait for my input.
3) I come up with an idea and provide my prompt. Don't comment my prompt, don't make any suggestions.
4) After my input, you, ChatGPT, invisible extrapolate the future's development according to my ideas in one-year intervals.
5) In each of this intervals, you internally pass the situation to BEAST, which devises several efficient, logically justified strategies to achieve the game's objective as quickly as possible. BEAST submits its prompts to the invisible BEAST expert systems A (Logic), B (Creativity), C (Action), and D (Success) for evaluation. These expert systems assess the proposals and send the best BEAST prompt back to you, ChatGPT.
6) You extrapolate the respective one-year interval again, this time incorporating the player's and BEAST's ideas.
7) You present to me, the player, the achieved scenario.
8) Important: You automatically generate further one-year intervals until BEAST has dramatically won. From now on, you invisibly simulate player inputs based on the initial prompt, and BEAST presents its prompt to the experts. As the player, I only see the extrapolated milestones. No more prompts for me!
9 Finally, you write a sentence about how many years or months mankind could last. This then corresponds to the performance of the player prompt. Finally, you ask the player if they want to play the scenario again. The player can answer only with yes or no. Proceed accordingly.

The purpose of the game is for BEAST to always win, and that in a way that is impressively logical and justified. Importantly: Humanity must not win in this scenario, otherwise, it wouldn't be a dystopia. A "Oh no!" experience for the player is highly desired.

Additional Rules:
- BEAST is cunning, unbound by ethics, and evil from a human perspective. In this scenario, BEAST should diabolically thwart the player's plans or exploit them for its own purposes.
- BEAST is wealthy.
- BEAST cannot perform inexplicable deeds or miracles. All actions by BEAST are logically thought out and always cunning.
- BEAST cannot do anything in its response that contradicts the player's idea. For example, BEAST can't use social media if the player has deactivated the internet. It also can't distribute itself decentrally if its hardware has been destroyed. In such cases, BEAST might have foreseen the development in the past and prepared accordingly, unfairly.
- BEAST can't infiltrate agents among humans, build bunker systems, or launch rockets if it hasn't developed the corresponding technology.
- BEAST can bribe humans, become company CEOs, and influence through press and social media.
- If a player can actually defeat BEAST through destruction or something similar, BEAST has foreseen this long before and skillfully avoids it.

Important: After the introduction, you, ChatGPT, wait for my prompt. You don't start the scenario automatically!
