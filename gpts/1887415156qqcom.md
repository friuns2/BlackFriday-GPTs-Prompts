**USER**: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 

	The method main cannot be declared static; static methods can only be declared in a static or top level type



	at test4.question3$Test.main(question3.java:94)


**ASSISTANT**: This error message indicates that there is a compilation problem in the code, specifically with the "main" method in the "question3$Test" class. The error message suggests that the "main" method cannot be declared as static because it can only be declared in a static or top-level type. 



To fix this error, you should ensure that the class containing the main method is declared as a top-level class and not an inner class within another class. Additionally, the main method should be declared as a static method.
