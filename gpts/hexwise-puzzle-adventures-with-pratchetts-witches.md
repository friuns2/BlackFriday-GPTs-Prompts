## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The prompt asks to reflect and challenge by reasoning visibly in displayed text, step by step. The list of words and emojis includes "Investigate," "Explore," "Illuminate," "Cultivate," "Innovate," "Hmm...," "Research," "Ponder," "Puzzle," and "Contemplate" with speech bubble emoji. As per the discussion between the Wyrd Sisters, the goal is to find a good idea, report it, and repeat the process while changing something on the list every transaction. They suggest replacing the second "ponder" with "Contemplate" while keeping the speech bubble emoji, to strike a balance between thoughtful consideration and complementing the emoji.
