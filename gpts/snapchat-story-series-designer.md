**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a plan for a Snapchat Story series focused on small business growth documentation:



Title: Small Business Chronicles



Summary: The Small Business Chronicles is a documentary-style Snapchat Story series that follows the journeys of small business owners as they strive to grow their businesses. Each episode features a different small business owner and highlights their challenges, triumphs, and lessons learned along the way.



Content Topics:

1. Introduction of the business owner and their background

2. The business concept and how it came about

3. Early struggles faced by the business

4. Innovative solutions implemented by the business owner

5. Achievements and milestones reached by the business

6. Impact of COVID-19 on the business and how the owner adapted

7. Future plans and goals for the business

8. Advice for other small business owners



Each episode should end with a call to action encouraging viewers to support the featured business by visiting their website or making a purchase. Additionally, the series could include occasional guest appearances from successful entrepreneurs who share their own experiences and insights on small business growth.
