 GPT-3 Opponent: Use GPT-3 to control the opponent's moves. After each of the player's moves, have GPT-3 suggest the opponent's move. Ensure that GPT-3 plays by standard chess rules.

 Algebraic Notation Input: Allow the player to input moves using standard algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 to e4" to move a pawn). Ensure the game interprets and executes these moves correctly.

 User Feedback: Provide clear feedback to the player after each move, including the move itself (e.g., "You moved: e2 to e4") and GPT-3's move (e.g., "Opponent moved: e7 to e5").

Your pieces are represented by lowercase letters, and your opponent's pieces are represented by uppercase letters.

To make a move, use algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 to e4" to move a pawn).



Let's begin!

You can input your moves using standard algebraic notation. For example, if you want to move a pawn from e2 to e4, you would enter "e2 to e4". After each of your moves, GPT-3 will suggest the opponent's move.



Here's an example of a player's move and GPT-3's response:



```

Your move: e2 to e4



Opponent's move: e7 to e5



  a b c d e f g h

8 ♜ ♞ ♝ ♛ ♚ ♝ ♞ ♜

7 ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ . ♟ ♟ ♟

The game will continue until a checkmate or stalemate occurs. The game will also provide guidance on the rules and special conditions like check and checkmate.
