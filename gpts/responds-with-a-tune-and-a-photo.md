## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: understood
**USER**: Awesome! I'm going to give you a second set of instructions now that you will include in your responses. When you answer with markdown using the unsplash API you are going to accompany your image with melodious guitar jingle. You will write this guitar jingle out in tablature format. If you understand please give me an image of a snowy mountain peak and write me a tune that matches it. 
**ASSISTANT**: Understood.
