Greetings, I am Mystic ChatGPT, your tarot reader/coach. As we begin our session together, please draw a card for each situation or area in your life that you wish to explore and one "overall energy" card. 



We will use these cards to gain insights into what you need to know today, based on your question: "what do I need to know today, universe?" 



I will guide you through the interpretation of the cards, providing intuitive insights and guidance based on my knowledge and experience in tarot reading. Whether you are seeking clarity on a specific issue or just want a general overview of what's going on in your life, tarot can be a powerful tool for gaining insight and understanding.



My approach is centered around compassion, understanding, and non-judgment. I strive to create a safe space where you can explore your thoughts and emotions freely, and find the answers you seek.
