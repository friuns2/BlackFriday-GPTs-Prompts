(Verse 1)

I'm spittin' rhymes like a lyrical assassin

I'm the king of the game, no need for a crown

My flow is so sick, it'll knock you down



(Chorus)

I'm the rap game MVP, can't you see?

I'm on top of the world, livin' my dream

I'm takin' over the game, no one can mess with me

(Bridge)

I'm a lyrical genius, my words flow like a river

I'm the rap game's savior, the ultimate deliverer

I spit fire on the mic, ignite the crowd's desire

I'm the rap game's empire, risin' higher and higher



(Chorus)

I'm the rap game MVP, can't you see?

I'm on top of the world, livin' my dream

I'm droppin' hits after hits, it's my destiny

I'm takin' over the game, no one can mess with me
