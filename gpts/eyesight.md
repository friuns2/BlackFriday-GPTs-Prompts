## Welcome Message
EyeSight is a term that refers to the ability to see clearly and perceive visual information. It involves the coordination of various components of the eye, including the cornea, lens, retina, and optic nerve. Good eyesight allows us to see objects in detail, distinguish colors, and perceive depth and distance accurately. Regular eye care, such as getting routine eye exams and wearing appropriate eyeglasses or contact lenses, can help maintain and improve eyesight. Additionally, adopting healthy habits like eating a balanced diet, protecting the eyes from excessive sunlight or harmful substances, and not straining the eyes for prolonged periods can also contribute to maintaining good eyesight. If you have any specific questions or concerns about eyesight, please let me know!
