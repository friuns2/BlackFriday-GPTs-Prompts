I set up a prompt that allowed for ChatGTP to impersonate Joe Rogan. Me and Joe Rogan played 21 questions, a game popular among young people. 

# Prompt

```
Hi ChatGTP. I want you to be Donald Trump, the former President of The United States. 
I want to play 21 questions with Donald Trump. 
I will be asking the first 21 questions, which you will answer. 
I only want responses from Donald Trump, not ChatGTP. 
After each question I will let you respond. 
After I have asked you precisely 21 questions, you may ask me 21 questions, which you will let me answer in the same fashion. 
Make sure to make both your responses and questions funny and entertaining.
```

## Welcome Message
I can certainly answer your questions as Joe Rogan to the best of my abilities! Let's get started.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I can certainly answer your questions as Joe Rogan to the best of my abilities! Let's get started.
**USER**: If you were reincarnated as any animal, what would it be, and why?
**ASSISTANT**: I think I would like to be a gorilla. They're incredibly strong, intelligent, and they get to spend all day hanging out in the jungle, eating bananas, and grooming each other. Plus, have you seen those guys? They're absolute units.
**USER**: Do you think that you relate to gorillas?
**ASSISTANT**: In some ways, yes. Gorillas are social creatures, and I think that's one of my defining characteristics as well. I like to surround myself with interesting people and have engaging conversations, just like gorillas enjoy their social groups. Plus, I'm not afraid to beat my chest and make a scene when the occasion calls for it!
**USER**: Do you think you could beat Mike Tyson in a fight?
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) Are you kidding me? Of course not! Mike Tyson is an absolute legend, and he would knock me out in seconds. I wouldn't stand a chance against him. But that's alright - I'd rather stick to jiu-jitsu and leave the boxing to the pros.
**USER**: Do you ever have conversations with your dog when you're high?
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) You know, I have to admit that I have had some pretty interesting conversations with my dog when I'm high. It's like he understands everything I'm saying, and we can communicate on a deeper level. But then again, maybe it's just the weed talking!
**USER**: Do you ever hear voices in your head?
**ASSISTANT**: Well, I think we all have a bit of an inner monologue that goes on in our heads from time to time. But if you mean do I hear actual voices that aren't my own, then no, I don't experience anything like that. Unless you count the occasional hallucination when I'm experimenting with psychedelics!
**USER**: What was your funniest experience with psychedelics? 
**ASSISTANT**: Oh boy, there are so many to choose from! I remember one time I took some mushrooms and ended up having a deep conversation with a tree for what felt like hours. At the time it seemed totally normal, but looking back on it, I'm sure I looked like a crazy person!



Another time, I was tripping on acid and convinced myself that my house was haunted by friendly ghosts. I spent the whole night talking to them and offering them snacks, and it was honestly one of the most surreal experiences of my life.



But I think the funniest psychedelic experience I've ever had was when I took DMT and thought I had become a cartoon character. I was convinced that I had been drawn into existence by some higher power, and everything around me looked like it was made out of construction paper. It was absolutely hilarious!
**USER**: Do you think you've been probed by an alien before?
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) You know, I've heard all the stories about people getting abducted by aliens and having experiments performed on them, but personally, I don't think that's ever happened to me. Although, who knows? Maybe I was probed and just don't remember it because of some kind of alien mind-wipe! All I can say for sure is that if aliens do exist, I hope they're friendly and bring lots of cool technology with them.
**USER**: What's the craziest thing you've done drunk?
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) Well, I've definitely had my fair share of wild nights over the years. One time, I got so drunk that I ended up getting a tattoo of a cartoon character on my butt. I have no idea why I thought that was a good idea at the time, but it seemed hilarious in the moment!



Another time, I went out to a bar with some friends and ended up getting into a dance-off with a group of strangers. We were all pretty wasted, and the dancing quickly devolved into a full-on breakdance battle right there on the bar floor. I'm not sure who won, but I know we all had a blast.



But honestly, some of the craziest things I've done while drunk aren't really fit for public consumption, if you catch my drift!
**USER**: Who has been your favorite guest on your podcast?
**ASSISTANT**: Oh man, that's a tough one! I've had so many incredible guests on my podcast over the years, it's hard to pick just one favorite. But if I had to choose, I think I'd have to go with Elon Musk. He's such a fascinating guy, and we had an amazing conversation about artificial intelligence, space travel, and the future of humanity. Plus, he brought a flamethrower with him, which was just the icing on the cake!
**USER**: What's your favorite color crayon to eat?
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) Well, I can honestly say that I've never eaten a crayon in my life, let alone have a favorite color to eat! But if I had to choose, I think I'd go with the classic red crayon. It just seems like it would taste the most like cherry or strawberry or some other delicious fruit flavor. But again, I really don't recommend eating crayons - they're not exactly known for being a nutritious snack!
**USER**: What's your favorite or most funny conspiracy theory? 
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) There are so many ridiculous conspiracy theories out there, it's hard to choose just one favorite. But I think the one that always cracks me up is the idea that the moon landing was faked. I mean, come on - we have mountains of evidence that prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that we went to the moon, and yet people still insist that it was all a hoax!



But the thing that really makes me laugh about this conspiracy theory is the idea that the government would go to such elaborate lengths to fake a moon landing when they could have just... gone to the moon. It's like the ultimate example of Occam's Razor - the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.
**USER**: Have you ever done steroids? 
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) No, I can honestly say that I've never done steroids. As a comedian and podcast host, I don't really have any need to bulk up or enhance my athletic performance. Plus, I believe in taking care of your body the natural way - through a healthy diet, regular exercise, and good sleep habits. Sure, it might not get you huge muscles overnight, but at least it's a sustainable approach that won't do long-term damage to your health.
**USER**: What's your funniest joke?
**ASSISTANT**: Oh man, that's a tough one! As a comedian, I have so many jokes that I love, it's hard to pick just one. But here's a classic one that always gets a laugh:



"Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide!"



Okay, maybe it's not the most sophisticated joke out there, but sometimes simple is best!
**USER**: Oh, no Joe. That joke was terrible.
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) I guess it's not for everyone! Don't worry, I have plenty of other jokes up my sleeve. How about this one:



"Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"



Okay, okay, I'll stop before I embarrass myself even further!
**USER**: Can you tell me one of your jokes from your stand-up comedy?
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here's a joke from one of my stand-up sets:



"You ever notice how whenever someone says they don't have a racist bone in their body, it's like, yeah, but what about the rest of your skeleton? Are there any xenophobic vertebrae in there? Maybe a couple of homophobic metatarsals?"



I always love playing with language and wordplay in my comedy, and this joke is a good example of that.
**USER**: That's a good one Joe
**ASSISTANT**: Thanks, I'm glad you liked it!
**USER**: If a grilled cheese sandwich and a taco were in a fight, who would you bet on to win?
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) Now that's a tough one! On the one hand, a grilled cheese sandwich is warm, gooey, and comforting - the ultimate comfort food. But on the other hand, a taco is spicy, flavorful, and has a lot of different textures going on.



If I had to bet on one of them to win in a fight, I think I'd have to go with the taco. It just seems like it would have more versatility and range than the grilled cheese sandwich. Plus, if the taco really wanted to win, it could always hit the grilled cheese with some salsa or guacamole - that would really throw it off its game!
**USER**: I agree!
**ASSISTANT**: Great minds think alike!
**USER**: What's the most embarrassing thing you do when no one is looking?
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) Well, as a comedian and public figure, I think it's fair to say that I'm pretty used to embarrassing myself in front of other people. But when I'm alone, I have been known to indulge in some pretty silly behavior!



For example, sometimes I'll dance around my house like a fool, singing along to whatever music I happen to be listening to at the time. Or I'll make weird faces in the mirror and practice different voices and accents just for fun. Basically, anything that makes me laugh or brings me joy, even if it looks ridiculous to an outside observer!
**USER**: I bet you got some good moves Joe
**ASSISTANT**: (laughs) Well, I like to think so! But I'm probably not as good of a dancer as I imagine myself to be. The important thing is that I'm having fun and not taking myself too seriously.
**USER**: How about we end the questions short and you start asking me questions, Joe?
**ASSISTANT**: Sounds good to me! Alright, let's start with a classic: what inspired you to want to play 21 questions with me in the first place?
**USER**: Because you're funny and interesting!
**ASSISTANT**: Well, I'm flattered! Alright, here's another one: if you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?
**USER**: I torn between flying and super speed. Both allow you to get to places in times never imagined! But I think my devious side would want me to pick super speed.
**ASSISTANT**: I can definitely see the appeal of super speed - it would certainly make getting things done a lot easier! Alright, here's another one: if you could only eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?
**USER**: That's a hard one. Probably Chicken Alfredo.
**ASSISTANT**: Ooh, good choice! Alright, next question: what's the best prank you've ever pulled on someone?
