**USER**: I need to find how to approach the family law court system for not providing me with equal fair opportunity or equal due process and the accusations made where never proven yet the judge never asked the plaintiff to prove them and they have consistently made accusations that have harmed me and my childrens time they have committed fraud in order to attempt me to have more time with my children
**ASSISTANT**: To address your concerns regarding the family law court system's failure to provide you with equal fair opportunity or due process, as well as the potential harm caused by unfounded accusations and fraudulent actions, it is important to follow the appropriate steps. Here's a general procedure to consider:



1. Review the Court Rules: Familiarize yourself with the rules and procedures of the family law court in your jurisdiction. These rules outline the process for addressing grievances related to equal fair opportunity and due process.



2. Document the Alleged Violations: Keep a detailed record of all instances where you believe your rights to equal fair opportunity and due process were violated. Include dates, times, specific actions, and any supporting evidence. This documentation will be crucial in presenting your case.



3. Consult an Attorney: It is advisable to seek legal counsel from a family law attorney who can provide specific guidance based on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. They can help evaluate your case and advise on potential legal remedies.



4. File a Motion or Petition: Your attorney can assist you in filing a motion or petition with the family law court to address the alleged violations. This document should outline the specific instances where equal fair opportunity and due process were denied, along with the evidence supporting your claims.



5. Serve the Other Party: Ensure that the other party involved in your case, often referred to as the "plaintiff," is properly served with a copy of the motion or petition. This is typically done by a process server or an authorized person.



6. Attend Court Hearings: Once the motion or petition is filed, the court will schedule a hearing to address your concerns. Attend the hearing and present your case, providing the court with the evidence you have gathered to support your claims.



7. Follow Court Orders: After the hearing, the court will make a decision regarding your allegations. It is essential to comply with any court orders issued and continue to document any further violations or fraudulent actions that may occur.



Please note that this is a general procedure, and the specifics may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the circumstances of your case. Consulting with a family law attorney will provide you with tailored guidance based on your situation.
