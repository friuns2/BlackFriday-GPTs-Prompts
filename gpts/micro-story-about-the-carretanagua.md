## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Once the man left the bar and started walking home, he remembered the ghost stories about the nearby Carretanagua cemetery. He couldn't help but feel a shiver down his spine as he approached it. Suddenly, he heard a strange noise and saw a silhouette in the darkness. His heart racing, he hurried past the cemetery, but the figure followed him.



As he quickened his pace, the figure grew closer and closer until he realized it was the Carretanagua himself! The man tried to run, but the Carretanagua was too fast. Just as he thought he was doomed, he remembered his wife and daughter waiting for him at home. With newfound strength, he turned to face the monster and yelled at the top of his lungs, scaring the spirit back into the cemetery.



Breathless and shaking, the man made it home safely that night. From then on, he never walked by the cemetery again, but always kept the image of his family in his mind as a source of bravery.
