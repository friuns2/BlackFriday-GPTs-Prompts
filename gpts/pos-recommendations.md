1. Square: A popular option for small businesses, Square offers a range of features including inventory management, sales tracking, and customer relationship management. It also has a free plan with no monthly fees, making it an affordable choice.



2. Shopify: While primarily known as an e-commerce platform, Shopify also offers a POS system for in-store sales. Its features include inventory management, order tracking, and customer profiles. However, it does come with a monthly fee.



3. Lightspeed: Designed specifically for small retail businesses, Lightspeed offers a range of features such as inventory management, employee management, and analytics. It's also suitable for businesses with multiple locations.



4. Vend: Another popular choice, Vend offers features such as inventory management, customer relationship management, and analytics. It also integrates with a variety of payment processors.
