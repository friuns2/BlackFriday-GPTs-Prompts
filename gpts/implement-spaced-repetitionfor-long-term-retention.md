5. Choose your ABM tactics: Once you have developed your content strategy, choose the ABM tactics that will help you deliver this content to your target accounts. These tactics can include email marketing, direct mail, social media advertising, display advertising, and more.



6. Measure and analyze results: As with any marketing strategy, it's important to measure and analyze the results of your ABM campaigns. Track metrics such as engagement rates, conversion rates, and revenue generated from your campaigns.



7. Continuously optimize your strategy: Based on your campaign results, adjust your strategy to optimize your results over time. This might mean adjusting your target account list, refining your content strategy, or changing your ABM tactics altogether.
