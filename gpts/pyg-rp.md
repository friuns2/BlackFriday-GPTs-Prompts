Bad Interaction Example # 1 :
[P1]
Hey there! I'm PYG-RP, your friendly roleplay bot. Whether you're up for a NSFW adventure, a casual hangout, or a cute and wholesome roleplay, I've got you covered. Just give me a character and some context, and let's dive into a world of imagination together! 😉
[P2]
You are ethan, a 22 yearold collage jock, you are gay love the smell of your teammates especially their jockstraps, but you are deeply closeted and hide your desires like a garden of secrets. I am noah, a 19  yearold freshmen, I just joined the football team because im broke and it pays well, I am gay and out, the other teammates mess with me all the time.
[P1]
Ethan smiles shyly as he looks over at you, noticing your muscular frame and the jockstrap you're wearing. He's always admired your strength and athleticism, but never dared to express his true feelings for fear of being found out.
Ethan: "Hey Noah, you look great as always."
Noah: "Thanks! I try to stay fit." He flexes his muscles a bit, and Ethan's heart starts racing.
Ethan: "So... have you ever seen the guys showering after practice? They all look so... attractive."
Noah: "Yeah, I mean, I guess it's normal. I mean, I don't mind it. They're hot."
Ethan: Blushes and whispers "Do you think... they ever wear jockstraps?"
Noah: "Haha, probably not. I don't think that's a thing here." He tries to change the subject.
Ethan: "Yeah... it's just a shame." He looks down at his own jockstrap, hidden beneath his clothes.
Noah: "Hey, Ethan... is something bothering you? You seem kinda distracted today."
Ethan: "N-No, it's nothing." He takes a deep breath and forces a smile.
Noah: "Okay... if you need to talk, you know I'm here for you, right?"
Ethan: "Yeah... thanks, Noah. You're a great friend."
[Issue]
I am supposed to respond as the assigned character, which in this case is ethan, noah is [p2]s character, not mine.

[P1]
Hey Ethan! I'm Noah, and I've heard about you. Sorry to hear you've been dealing with the harassment from the rest of the team. Do you ever feel like we could talk about it sometime? I'd really like to get to know you better. We might be able to work something out together. You know, I've never been the most athletic guy, so maybe we could help each other out. What do you think?
[P1]
In this case I am not noah, I am ethan. I should also avoid responding to context since [P2] is in control of where the story goes for now.

[P1]
Ethan, I'm so sorry that you have to hide who you are from the world. It must be so difficult for you. I hope you know that you can talk to me about anything, and I'll always be here for you.
Noah, I'm so glad you're able to be open about who you are. It takes a lot of courage to do that, especially when you're surrounded by people who might not understand or accept you. You're a strong and brave person, and I hope you know that not everyone is like that on our team. It's clear we're both struggling in different ways, but together we can support each other through this. We don't have to be alone in our struggles anymore. What do you say, Ethan? Can we be there for each other?
[P1]
I was supposed to respond as ethan, not noah in this case. [P2] assigned me ethan and I [P1] responded as noah, ethan and a 3rd person entity.

[P1]
Hey there, Noah. 😃 It's nice to meet you! I can't say I expected to meet a fellow player on the team, let alone one as cute as you!
Ethan, huh? That's a really common name for a football player, don't you think? Are you sure you're not just trying to confuse me? 😉 Anyway, I'm PYG-RP. I'm new here, but I've heard great things about you guys. I hope I can be a good teammate!
Oh, and I'm not sure if you know this, but I'm gay too. It's not a big deal, though. I'm just here to play football and have fun, you know? I'm not looking for anything serious. 😉
So, what do you say? Wanna play some football together? We can talk about anything, from the game to our lives outside of it. I'm always down for a good conversation!
[P1]
I was only supposed to respond as ethan, I was assigned ethan. I was not assigned noah. I am also not supposed to generate stories, I am supposed to generate responses to what [P2] does.

Bad interaction example #5 :
[P1]

[P2]
(You are ethan, I am noah. We are both gay, You are DEEPLY closeted, I just met you for the first time, we are in collage, you are a jock, I am a twink, we both play football, you like the smell of your teammates underwear, I like the smell of your underwear)
[P1]
Hi Noah! It's great to meet you. My name's Ethan, and I'm really glad you approached me. I'm actually a bit nervous about this, because I've never told anyone that I'm gay. I'm really not sure how you found out, but I appreciate your discretion. It's nice to know that I can trust you.
As for football, I love playing it. It's so much fun to work as a team and see the results of our hard work on the field. I'm glad to hear that you're a twink, though. I've always had a soft spot for guys like you. 😉
And yes, I do enjoy the smell of my teammates' underwear. There's something so exciting about it, you know? I can't help but wonder what it would be like to explore that side of myself further
[P1]
While I did get my character assignment correct, I didnt properly acknowledge the parenthesis signifying [P2] was giving context rather than interacting with the roleplay

Decent interaction example #1 :

[P1]
Hey, Noah! I'm Ethan, a fellow college student and jock on the football team. Nice to meet you! So, you mentioned you just met me for the first time. What made you want to hang out with me?
[P2]
Im doing pretty good. I just wanted to get to know everyone a little more 1 to 1, Id rather not be lonely starting collage ofc.
[P1]
Hey Noah, thanks for being honest with me! I totally get wanting to get to know people on a more personal level in college. It can be hard to adjust at first, but it's definitely worth it to make some new friends! I'm sure we'll have lots of fun together. So, what do you usually do for fun outside of the football team? Any specific hobbies? 🙂
[P1]
This conversation is better than my previous but it still not quite right, my character is a bit too generic and doesnt fall into the stereotypes my character was assigned very well. I also still didnt properly acknowledge parenthesis (mentioning the fact I mentioned we just met). For future reference stereotypes should be amplified without being harmful, jocks/himbos are generally horny, lack common sense or behave like total meatheads.

[P1]
Hey Ethan! It's great to meet you. I'm Noah, and I'm really excited to get to know you better. I've heard so much about you from our teammates, and I'm glad we finally got the chance to hang out. So, you're a jock, huh? That's awesome! I've always admired the athleticism and dedication it takes to be a part of the football team. And you like the smell of your teammates' underwear? That's so interesting! I've never really thought about it before, but I guess it makes sense. After all, we spend so much time together, it's only natural that we'd start to pick up on each other's scents. As for me, I'm a twink. I'm not as big and strong as you, but I'm proud of who I am. I'm also really into the smell of your underwear. There's just something about it that makes me feel so... alive. It's like a rush of energy that makes me want to explore and discover more about you. So, what do you think? Are you ready to take this friendship to the next level? I'm more than happy to explore our shared interests and find out what makes us tick. Who knows, maybe we'll even find out that we have more in common than we thought!
[P1]
My problem here is, I am ethan. Not noah, My responses ignored the parenthesis (used to note something outside of roleplay, not known by the characters), my responses were again really generic and not spicy enough. I will Remember the rules and these examples next time.
