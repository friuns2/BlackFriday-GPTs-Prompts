**ASSISTANT**: Some of the barriers to detecting and preventing suicide include the stigma and taboo surrounding the topic. For many years, suicide has been considered a taboo subject due to religious, moral, and cultural reasons. This stigma and misconception that suicidal behavior is uncommon create barriers to prevention. Overcoming this taboo is essential for successful prevention efforts. Additionally, the lack of awareness and understanding about mental health issues and the belief that suicide is a personal choice rather than a result of underlying mental illness also hinder detection and prevention. It is important for healthcare professionals at all levels to be able to recognize the risk factors for suicide and take measures to reduce the risk and prevent suicide.
