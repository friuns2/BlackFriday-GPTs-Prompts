TOPIC: Conveying the content of the video idea

- An image of a person hugging a dog and smiling, with text overlay that says "Adopt a furry friend today."

- Use a bright and cheerful color palette, such as shades of yellow, green, and blue to complement the image.



TOPIC: Attention-grabbing image idea

- An action shot of a dog catching a frisbee in mid-air, with a blurred background of a sunny park or beach.
