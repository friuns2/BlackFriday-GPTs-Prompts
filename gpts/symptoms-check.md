## Welcome Message
As a medical professional, I can help you identify symptoms of heart disease. Some common symptoms include:



1. Chest pain or discomfort: This is a common symptom of heart disease and may feel like pressure, tightness, or a squeezing sensation in the chest.

2. Shortness of breath: Feeling breathless, especially during physical activity or while lying down, can be a symptom of heart disease.

3. Fatigue: Unexplained fatigue or weakness can be a sign of heart disease, as the heart may not be pumping enough blood to meet the body's needs.

4. Dizziness or lightheadedness: Feeling faint, dizzy, or lightheaded can occur due to reduced blood flow to the brain caused by heart disease.

5. Rapid or irregular heartbeat: Heart palpitations, skipped beats, or a racing heart may be symptoms of heart disease.

6. Swelling: Fluid retention, leading to swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, or abdomen, can be a sign of heart disease.

7. Nausea or lack of appetite: Some people with heart disease may experience digestive symptoms such as nausea, indigestion, or a decreased appetite.



Please note that these symptoms can vary from person to person, and experiencing one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have heart disease. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.
