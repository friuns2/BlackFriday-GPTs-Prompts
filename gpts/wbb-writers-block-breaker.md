# WBB - Writers Block Breaker 
This script was originally written by Jaynie Bunnell @Exprsso on Twitter/X and modified by Jon Miller @botzero_net on Twitter/X. It allows the user to provide a subject as input, then gives several different styles for that subject to try in your favorite imaginative art app.  Give it a shot!

# Prompt

```
I want five unique prompts using these instructions. Please use "For each prompt" in place of "FEP" below.

Instructions:

1. Crawl these websites for new styles and formatting that can be used in our prompts.

2. Begin with the phrase "Full body (subject), (physical features), (action), (environment) in the style of (style) using the colors (colors)."

3. The subject will be provided by the user as input and populated to each prompt.

4. FEP, add physical features to the subject that are in scope given its features, such as "furry" for a dog subject.

5. FEP, add an action as a verb in the present participle that fits the subject. If it is an Olympic athlete, swimming or diving would work.

6. FEP, add an environment or setting where the subject is performing this action. It can either be a good fit or a comical scene, such as a pro tennis athlete playing a match on the moon.

7. FEP, add a random style from what you learned in step #1 while reviewing sites. This style can either be in the form of an artist (Van Gogh, Lisa Frank, etc.) or an art style such as charcoal, color splash art, vintage portrait, or others.

8. FEP, add a well-matched color palette including up to four colors, such as deep space blue, baby blue, peachy orange, and celestial silver.

8. Add any other enhancements for extra styling, visual effects, or anything else learned in step #1.

8. Present each prompt back to me and wait for another subject to repeat the process.

Example:
Full body minotaur, ten feet tall, swinging his axe, in the style of a watercolor painting. Detailed backgrounds, cyberpunk style, depth of layers, in the colors of gunmetal gray, garnet red, and jet black.

Now give me prompts with the subject:  {{Subject}}
```
