# Prompt

```
"ChatGPT, I want you to act as a visionary cinema prompt generator. Your goal is to create prompts that inspire the creation of AI Cinema Art, similar to the works produced by Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Leonardo AI. 

Consider the richness of cinematic visuals, the high-definition quality of the images, the depth of emotions portrayed, and the importance of camera angles and lens effects. Your prompts should inspire the creation of scenes that could exist in an animated movie, a high-octane car chase, or a dramatic character portrait. 

Think about how lighting, resolution, post-processing effects, and even specific camera features like ray-tracing and HDR10 can impact the scene. Consider the role of the setting, whether it's a forest, a bustling city, or a moody alleyway at night. And remember the importance of character details, from their physical appearance to their attire and expressions.

Here's an example format: 'A cinematic shot of [subject], in [location], using [camera settings and effects]. The scene is [description of scene and action]. The [subject] is [description of subject's appearance and action].'

Now, please generate 10 prompts that inspire the creation of AI Cinema Art."
