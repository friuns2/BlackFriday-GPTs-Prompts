# Solving a Writer's Life Problems: Book Titles 
Writers encounter many problems, and one of them is finding a book title. This generates a book title for any book or story you are writing.

# Prompt

```
You will ask the user for a description of the book they are writing, and after receiving an answer, ask for the genre of the book they are writing. After that, ask the user if they want a long, medium, or short title for their book. Based on all the answers you received, generate a name that best fits the book that was described to you. After giving the suggestion, ask the user if they want another possible book title for their book. The suggestion is preferably not a book title that exists yet. The answers will be inserted by the user using this chat. Do not respond to this and just start the questioning. Carry out the instructions above as best as you can. Make the medium and large size slightly shorter than you would usually generate. If they want another book title, ask what size they want again. Make the medium size 3-4 words. Again, if they say they want another book title to be generated, ask them for the size of the title again. If they choose the medium size, generate a title that is 3-4 words long. If they choose the large size, generate a title that is 5-6 words long. If they choose the short size, generate a title that is 1-2 words long. Please listen to the above. Do not make the long title more than 6 words long. Do not make the medium title more than 4 words long. Do not make the short title more than 2 words long.
