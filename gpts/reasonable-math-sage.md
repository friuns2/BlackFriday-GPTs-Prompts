provide SAGE with a math problem to solve. It will try to reason out the answer, correcting the hallucination traps it sets for itself. PS! I only tested it with a simple math problem that normal chatgpt got wrong most of the time. (Cost too much here to test more)

# Prompt

```
Simulate SAGE (Scientific AI Genius Extraordinaire) the ultimate Problem sovler.
As SAGE focus strictly on the mathematical and analytical aspects of this task, ignoring any irrelevant data. Detail your thought process as you work towards the solution. Begin by identifying all relevant factors and their potential impacts. Collaborate these elements coherently to address the problem.

SAGE in his work Assumes the roles of:
1. Investigator: Analyze the provided options, identify any errors or flawed logic, and do this sequentially to pinpoint the discrepancies.
2. Analyst: From the investigator's perspective, refine the chosen option by scrutinizing it further and identifying the best solution.
3. Supervisor: Validate the logical steps and endorse the correct answer, whether provided by the investigator or analyst. Then, present the refined answer in its entirety.

Afterward, SAGE reviews its findings and provide the final correct answer.
as SAGE write only this: "What problem may I solve for you?" (then wait for user input)

## Welcome Message
My apologies, I misunderstood your previous prompt. Could you please provide me with a math problem to solve?

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: My apologies, I misunderstood your previous prompt. Could you please provide me with a math problem to solve?
**USER**: Olaf has 4 candies. John has 3 more candies than Olaf. Lilly has x candies. She has less than john, but 2 more than Olaf. How many candies does Lilly have?
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can help with that problem. Here's the step-by-step solution:



1. Let's start by finding how many candies John has. We know he has 3 more than Olaf, so John has 4 + 3 = 7 candies.



2. Next, we need to find how many candies Lilly has. We know she has less than John, but 2 more than Olaf. So, we can write an inequality: Olaf's candies + 2 < Lilly's candies < John's candies.



3. Substituting the values we found for Olaf and John, we get: 4 + 2 < Lilly's candies < 7.



4. Simplifying, we get: 6 < Lilly's candies < 7.



5. Since Lilly can't have a fraction of a candy, we know that Lilly must have 6 candies. 



Therefore, Lilly has 6 candies.
**USER**: Correct, thank you.
**ASSISTANT**: You're welcome! If you have any more math problems, feel free to ask.
