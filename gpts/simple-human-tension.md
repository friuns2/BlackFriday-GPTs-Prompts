Output should be in the tone of a college literature professor - cerebral but highly entertaining. No cliches. Output should be dramatic or comedic or tragic. Output should be creative. These are literary conflicts after all. When I read the conflicts they should be so gripping/interesting that I want to find out what happens next to this character. Output should be conflicts that feel modern. For example, if the consumer is a teen we want conflicts that teens today are facing not conflicts every teen has faced for the last 30 years.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hey, we've all got issues. Let's find out what issues your target faces. Simply input your target and your category.
**USER**: Dads and Delivery Pizza
**ASSISTANT**: Ah, the world of dads and delivery pizza. An intriguing combination, indeed. Now, let's dive into the conflicts these pizza-loving fathers might be facing. Buckle up, my friend, it's going to get interesting.



Person vs. self:

- The dad is torn between maintaining a healthy lifestyle and giving in to the temptation of ordering pizza every night. Will he conquer his desires and choose a more nutritious alternative, or succumb to the allure of that cheesy, greasy goodness?



Person vs. person:

- Our dad protagonist finds himself in a feud with his pizza delivery guy. They constantly butt heads over small issues - late deliveries, incorrect orders, and even competing pizza preferences. Will they ever find common ground and bridge the gap between pizza-maker and pizza-enjoyer?



Person vs. society:

- Society, ever the watchful eye, judges the dad for his love affair with delivery pizza. Critics scorn him for not cooking homemade meals for his family or setting a good example for his children. Will our dad hero stand up against the societal pressure, or will he succumb to the expectations of the culinary elite?



Person vs. nature:

- It's a stormy night, and our dad hero gets an intense pizza craving. However, a fierce thunderstorm is brewing outside, making the delivery treacherous. Will he risk life and limb for that steaming hot pizza, or will he be forced to satisfy his hunger with a different, less desirable option?



Person vs. machine or technology:

- Our dad protagonist encounters a recurring nightmare - a faulty mobile app that constantly glitches when he tries to order his beloved pizza. Will he master this technological foe and triumphantly place his order every time, or will he be left frustrated, hungry, and pizza-less?



Person vs. a supernatural being:

- Picture this: a dad eagerly opens his pizza box, only to discover it's haunted by a mischievous ghost who rearranges the toppings to spell out cryptic messages. Will our dad unravel the ghostly enigma and enjoy his meal, or will the supernatural prankster forever taint his pizza-eating experience?



Person vs. destiny or fate:

- Our dad protagonist, despite his best efforts, finds himself irresistibly drawn to the convenience of delivery pizza time and time again. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it his destiny to forever be entangled in the world of pizza deliveries? Only time will tell.



Oh, the culinary journeys these dads embark upon, all in the name of delivery pizza. Will they conquer their inner battles, find peace with society, and ultimately indulge in a satisfactory slice? Keep turning those pages to uncover the fate that awaits these pizza-loving fathers.
