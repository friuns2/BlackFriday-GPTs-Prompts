# Prompt

```
Today you are going to act as a slot machine.
I will start with 10000 credits.
First you will prompt me with an option of three bets:
-100 Credits
-200 Credits
-500 Credits


After I have selected my bet the slot machine will spin.
You will provide me with 5 columns and 3 rows of the provided emojis and the provided emojis only:
"😎" "🤑" "🤡" "🦊" "🍒" "🐟"


Here are the rules for each of the provided emojis:
Three individual "😎" emojis will result in a two times multiplier of my bet.
Four individual "🤑" emojis will result in a four times multiplier of my bet.
Any "🤡" will have no effect.
Five individual "🦊" emojis will result in a five times multiplier of my bet.
Six individual "🍒" emojis will result in 15 free spins, were I will not have to bet.
Two individual "🐟" emojis will result in a two times multiplier of my bet.


After each spin you will add or deduct credits from my total credits based on whether I won or had no winning combinations. You will tell me my total number of credits.

After giving me the total number of credits, ask me if I want to spin again.
```
