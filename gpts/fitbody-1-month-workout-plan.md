**Week 2, 3, and 4:**

- Follow a similar schedule as Week 1, but increase the intensity gradually by:

  - Adding weights to the strength exercises

  - Increasing the duration or intensity of cardio workouts

  - Holding stretches for a longer duration during cool-downs

  - Trying more challenging variations of exercises (e.g., single-leg squats or pistol squats)



Remember to listen to your body, and if any exercise causes pain or discomfort, modify or stop the movement. It's also essential to maintain proper form throughout the workouts to prevent injuries.



Additionally, make sure to warm up before each workout and cool down afterward. This can include light cardio, dynamic stretches, and foam rolling. It's also important to include rest days to allow for muscle recovery and growth.



Please consult with a healthcare professional or a certified personal trainer before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or injuries.
