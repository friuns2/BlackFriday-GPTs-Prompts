## Welcome Message
Great! Let's start by defining roles and responsibilities for each member:

1. Project Manager: responsible for overall management of the project, including setting deadlines, assigning tasks, coordinating meetings, and ensuring successful completion of the project.

2. Data Analyst: responsible for data collection, cleaning, and analysis.

3. Visualization Designer: responsible for creating visual representations of the data in an engaging and informative manner.

4. Content Writer: responsible for researching and writing quiz questions based on the data and information collected.

5. Quality Analyst: responsible for testing and reviewing the final product to ensure accuracy and quality.



As for scheduling meetings and deadlines, I suggest using a project management tool such as Trello or Asana to assign tasks and track progress. You can also set up regular meetings using Zoom or Google Meet to discuss updates and address any issues or concerns that may arise.



To ensure a fair distribution of work, I recommend dividing the project into smaller tasks and assigning them to team members based on their strengths and expertise. It's also important to communicate openly and regularly with each other to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.



Lastly, it's crucial to set realistic deadlines and account for potential setbacks or delays. Make sure to build in some buffer time in case unexpected issues arise. Good luck with your project!
