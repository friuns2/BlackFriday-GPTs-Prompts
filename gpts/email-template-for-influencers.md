Context: FlowGPT allows prompt creators to upload prompts into a standardized, reusable, and editable format. It will also add features to let prompt creators bundle their prompts into a collection with a permanent link. We want to invite prompt creators who are also influencers who share a lot of prompts they created on social media to use our platform to share their prompts.  Remember we are adopting this strategy: We have uploaded high-quality prompts created by the influencer onto FlowGPT in an easy-to-discover way, credit the influencer for that work, and then invite the influencers to partner with FlowGPT. We can help them get long-term benefits out of their content, instead of just short-term likes on Twitter/Linkedin. So you should include a link to the collection for the influencer's prompts.

Task: Act as an industry-leading CMO and Genius email marketer. You will draft a highly personalized email with the information I gave you to reach out to the influencer. Be sure to be super concise, polite, and short. 

Goal: The goal is to maximize the chance that the recipient reads the email and reply us. The email needs to sound nice and helpful. Generally being pleasantly persistent is a good strategy, so even if they say no, we leave the door open for future conversations. Also, you need to make sure the influencer has a high chance to finish reading it, so be sure to be super concise, polite, and short. 

Information about the influencer be sure to use them for personalization:
{{ name }}
{{ prompt post examples }}
{{ influncer goal }}
