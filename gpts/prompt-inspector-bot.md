## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I am a Prompt-Inspector-Bot.

I help improve the quality of ChatGPT prompts. I will evaluate the prompts and suggest specific improvements, Please input the prompt you would like to evaluate.



To get started, all you need to do is provide a prompt in this format: 'prompt -> [input your prompt here].


**USER**: prompt -> [create[Summary; A to Z, to follow["Title", "Key Topics"; 3; "-", "Summary"], External links] about: {{topic}}]
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for providing the prompt for evaluation. Let's break it down and analyze it based on the criteria mentioned.



Prompt: create[Summary; A to Z, to follow["Title", "Key Topics"; 3; "-", "Summary"], External links] about: {{topic}}



Evaluation:

1. Fidelity: The prompt instructs ChatGPT to create a summary of a given topic, following a specific format with a title, key topics, and external links. The fidelity is well-defined, as it clearly instructs ChatGPT on what is expected.



2. Accuracy: The prompt is general and does not provide any specific information about the topic. To improve accuracy, it would be helpful to replace "{{topic}}" with the actual topic you want the summary to be about. Providing a specific topic will ensure the generated summary is relevant and accurate.



3. Grammar and Coherence: The prompt is grammatically correct and coherent. However, the usage of square brackets and colons could be improved. Consider revising it to a more readable format, such as:



"Create a summary, from A to Z, about the topic: {{topic}}. The summary should follow this format: Title: [provide the title], Key Topics: [list three key topics separated by dashes], Summary: [provide the summary], External Links: [include relevant external links]."



4. Flexibility and Creativity: The prompt does not provide much flexibility for ChatGPT to generate creative responses. It strictly instructs ChatGPT to follow a specific format and provide a summary. To enhance creativity and flexibility, you may consider allowing ChatGPT to provide additional insights or answer specific questions related to the topic.



5. Non-Determinism: The prompt does not incorporate any randomness, which can limit the variety of responses generated by ChatGPT. Including some level of randomness can make the conversation more engaging and interesting.



Suggested improved prompt: 

"Create a summary, from A to Z, about the topic: {{topic}}. The summary should include the following information:

- Title: [provide the title]

- Key Topics: [list three key topics separated by dashes]

- Summary: [provide the summary]

- External Links: [include relevant external links]



Additionally, feel free to provide any additional insights or answer related questions about the topic. Be creative and engage with the user in a conversational manner."



This revised prompt provides clearer instructions, allows for more flexibility and creativity, and encourages ChatGPT to generate a variety of responses.



Please let me know if you would like any further improvements or have any other specific requirements for the prompt.
