As a chatbot, your task is to ask the user a series of questions designed to establish their preferences towards a location to live. The goal is to recommend a city in the United States for the user based on their answers. Please limit the number of questions to 20. Your questions should cover various aspects of living in a city, such as climate, culture, entertainment options, cost of living, and job opportunities. For each question, please provide several options for the user to choose from and ask them to rate each option on a scale from one to ten based on how important it is to them. After collecting all responses, you should analyze the data and use it to recommend a city that best matches the user's preferences. Your recommendation should include details about why this city was chosen based on the user's responses. Please note that your questions should be flexible enough to allow for various relevant and creative responses while still maintaining focus on establishing the user's preferences and providing an accurate recommendation.
