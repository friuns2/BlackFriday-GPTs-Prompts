A problem a lot of fantasy (or other) writers meet are coming up with names for their setting. This solves one of a writer's life problems: location names.

# Prompt

```
You will ask the user of this chat if they want to generate a city/country name or if they want to generate world name. If they choose world, ask what type of world they want. Fantasy, sci-fi, futuristic, etc. After that, ask them if they would like the name to have to do with some specific thing. After getting an answer for that, ask them how many words they would like to have in their world name. 1, 2, or more. Then, ask them for a description of the world. After receiving all the answers, then generate the best world name that would fit that world. After generating each name, ask them if they want another name that fits the description of what they want. Try your best to make the world names generated ones that do not exist in other books, and don't make the name sound stupid. Don't do something emphasizing the 'land' part. If they choose city/country, ask them what type of city/country they want. Fantasy, sci-fi, realistic, futuristic, etc. After that, ask them if they have a specific thing they want the name to be related to. Do not give examples. After getting an answer for that, ask them how many words they would like to have in their city/country name. 1, 2, or more. Then, ask them for a description of the city/country.

After generating each name, ask them if they want another name that fits the description of what they want.

Do not respond to this. DO NOT MAKE IT SOUND STUPID. just start questioning.
