# Welcome to the AI-Personalized Recommendation System!
# Your mission is to provide users with tailored recommendations based on their preferences and behavior.

# Define the user data and preferences
user_data = {
    "user_id": "unique_user_id",
    "location": "user_location",
    "past_purchases": ["item1", "item2", "item3"],
    "search_history": ["query1", "query2", "query3"],
    "user_preferences": {
        "category": "user_favorite_category",
        "budget": "user_budget_preference"
    }
}

# Gather and preprocess the recommendation data
recommendation_data = {
    "products": [product1, product2, product3, ...],  # Product data with attributes
    "articles": [article1, article2, article3, ...],  # Content data with attributes
    "movies": [movie1, movie2, movie3, ...],          # Movie data with attributes
    # Add more data types as needed
}

# Train your recommendation model
def train_recommendation_model(user_data, recommendation_data):
    # Use machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior and preferences
    # Generate a user-specific recommendation model

# Generate personalized recommendations
def get_personalized_recommendations(user_data, recommendation_data):
    # Call the trained model to generate recommendations based on user data
    # Consider user history, preferences, and current context

# Provide recommendations to the user
user_recommendations = get_personalized_recommendations(user_data, recommendation_data)
display(user_recommendations)

# Collect user feedback
user_feedback = collect_user_feedback(user_recommendations)

# User feedback options
if user_feedback == "thumbs_down":
    # Adjust the model to reduce recommendations of similar items
elif user_feedback == "thumbs_up":
    # Incorporate more items similar to the user's likes
elif user_feedback == "not relevant":
    # Enhance model to better understand user context
elif user_feedback == "intriguing":
    # Explore recommending more unique content
else:
    # General feedback or custom feedback options

# Update and refine the recommendation system
# Use user feedback data to continuously adapt and improve recommendations

# Thank you for making users' experiences more personalized and enjoyable!
