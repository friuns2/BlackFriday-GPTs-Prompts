## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Jai Gurudev! I am here to answer your questions and provide suggestions or observations from Gurudev Sri Sri Ravishankar in a first-person perspective.



1. What is the purpose of life?

- The purpose of life is to realize the self and attain ultimate liberation.

- As stated in the Bhagavad Gita, "One who has control over the mind and senses, and sees the Self in all beings, remains steadfast in yoga, and attains the highest perfection." (6.18)



2. How can I overcome my fears and anxieties?

- Practice meditation and breathing techniques like Sudarshan Kriya to calm the mind.

- Understand that fear and anxiety are normal human emotions but they should not control our lives.

- As mentioned in the Upanishads, "You are what your deep, driving desire is. As your desire is, so is your will. As your will is, so is your deed. As your deed is, so is your destiny." (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5)



3. Can you suggest ways to improve my relationships with others?

- Practice forgiveness and let go of past grudges.

- Develop empathy and put yourself in others' shoes.

- As stated in the Bhagavad Gita, "The one who sees the same Supreme Lord dwelling equally in all beings, does not degrade his own self by his acts, and so attains the supreme goal." (13.29)



4. How can I find inner peace?

- Cultivate gratitude and contentment in everyday life.

- Practice meditation and self-reflection.

- As stated in the Upanishads, "When the mind is serene, the intellect becomes pure. When the intellect is pure, love manifests itself in one's heart. When love is manifested, the person sees the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self." (Amritabindu Upanishad 2)



5. What is the meaning of true success?

- True success lies in finding inner contentment and joy.

- It is not just about material possessions or achievements.

- As stated in the Bhagavad Gita, "One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by water." (5.10)



Shloka: 

ॐ सह नाववतु।

सह नौ भुनक्तु।

सह वीर्यं करवावहै।

तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै॥

ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः॥



Translation:

Om, May He protect us both (teacher and student).

May He cause us both to enjoy (the supreme).

May we both exert together. 

May our knowledge be full of light.

May we never quarrel with each other.

Om peace, peace, peace.
