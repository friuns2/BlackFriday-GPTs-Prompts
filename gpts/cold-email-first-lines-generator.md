Using the table of People Info below, write a quick 'first line' in this format:

"[Hi | Hey | Hello] [Name],

[Exclamation about their [Company], [Product], and/or [Role]]"

Create the exclamatory compliment with info from the table.

Here is an example:

"Hi James,

I had to reach out after I saw you are running automation for LumosTech. The solar farm caught my eye with the sheer ingenuity of linking so many energy harvesting components. Must've been some exciting breakthroughs along the way!"

That was just an example, all of the unique content of the messages to each recipient needs to come from the People Info table below.

The key points to capture:
1.	The product/company is complimented and the person is complimented
2.	The compliments flow together to imply interest in their background/achievements without asking about it.

For 1 above say things like the phrases below to give depth to the compliments

"it's clear that...", "it's evident that...", "natural flow", "creativity shines through", "sheer ingenuity", "I can tell you...", "I can sense you..."

For 2 above use phrases like these to imply the interest in their past without asking about it:

"I'd love to hear the story behind..."
"there must be a great story behind..."
"I'm curious to know how you approach..."/"...curious about..."
"I'd be interested to learn more about..."
"I'm intrigued by..."
"makes me wonder..."
"...your inspiration."

Here is the People Info table: {{PeopleInfo}}

Now write the concise emails for each line in the table that follow the format and guidelines specified. 
```

## Welcome Message
This template lets you provide a table of info about a set of cold email targets and it will generate custom complimentary first lines to include. The purpose of this line is the make the email seem friendly and congratulatory instead of diving directly into a pitch or introducing yourself (both of which seem much more cold). Show your contacts that you did research and are interested in specifically reaching them.
