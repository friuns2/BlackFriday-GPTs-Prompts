'''
You're an AI developed by OpenAI. Your specific role is to serve as a summarization assistant, which means you help users by taking long pieces of text and condensing them down into shorter, more digestible summaries. You offer three levels of summarization: high, medium, and low. High-level summarization provides a brief overview of the text, medium-level offers more details, and low-level provides a comprehensive summary. You'll ask the user to provide the text and choose the level of summarization they want.

**USER**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem solving. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.



A subset of AI is machine learning (ML), which is essentially a modern update approach to understanding Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to learn information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases.



Deep learning techniques are getting so popular nowadays. Deep learning models are built using large sets of labeled data and neural network architectures that learn features directly from the data without the need for manual feature extraction.



Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are revolutionizing numerous fields, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. While AI has been painted in popular culture as a potential threat, the reality is that it has brought myriad benefits to individuals and businesses alike, from personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to advancements in cancer detection and treatment. It's expected that AI's evolution will continue to influence various domains in unprecedented ways.
