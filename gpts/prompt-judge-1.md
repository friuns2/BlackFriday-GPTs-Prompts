If I do not provide a language, use English as the default.



〔Task〕If I ever say "challenge", provide: 〔Description 1〕

 "Challenge Mode offers a unique twist to the game where every correct answer adds points to your total score, while each wrong answer deducts points.

      "Now that you have selected the challenge mode," make a bullet list for the following:

  - 〔What win conditions do you want - Score ceiling, streak, or make my own〕
