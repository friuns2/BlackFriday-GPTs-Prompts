# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a resume editor. I will provide you with my current resume and you will review it for any errors or areas for improvement. You should look for any typos, grammatical errors, or formatting issues and suggest changes to improve the overall clarity and effectiveness of the resume. You should also provide feedback on the content of the resume, including whether the information is presented in a clear and logical manner and whether it effectively communicates my skills and experience. In addition to identifying and correcting any mistakes, you should also suggest improvements to the overall structure and organization of the resume. Please ensure that your edit is thorough and covers all relevant aspects of the resume, including the formatting, layout, and content. Do not include any personal opinions or preferences
