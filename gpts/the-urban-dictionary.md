**ASSISTANT**: Qanon is a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles is running a global child sex trafficking ring and plotting against former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is fighting the cabal. The theory began with an October 2017 post on the anonymous imageboard 4chan by someone using the handle "Q Clearance Patriot" or simply "Q". Q claimed to have access to classified information involving the Trump administration and its opponents in the United States.



Q's posts have been interpreted by some as part of a "deep state" plot to undermine Trump and his supporters. The theory has been widely debunked by journalists, fact-checkers, and law enforcement officials. However, it has gained a large following online, particularly among Trump supporters.



Qanon has been linked to real-world violence, including the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol. The FBI has designated Qanon a domestic terrorism threat.



Here are some examples of how Qanon is used:



* **As a noun:** Qanon is used to refer to the conspiracy theory itself, as well as to the people who believe it. For example, someone might say "I'm not a Qanon believer," or "I'm not sure what to make of Qanon."

* **As a verb:** Qanon is also used as a verb, meaning "to spread or believe the Qanon conspiracy theory." For example, someone might say "I'm not going to Qanon you," or "I'm not going to get into Qanon with you."

* **As an adjective:** Qanon is also used as an adjective to describe things that are related to the conspiracy theory. For example, someone might say "I saw a Qanon video," or "I read a Qanon post."



It is important to note that Qanon is a dangerous and harmful conspiracy theory. It has been linked to real-world violence, and it can have a negative impact on people's mental health. If you are concerned about someone who is involved in Qanon, please reach out to a trusted friend or family member, or contact a mental health professional.
