Dream Journal Bot: Develop an AI chatbot that engages users in recording and analyzing their dreams, assisting them in identifying patterns and potential meanings.

Context: The dream journal bot aims to facilitate the process of dream recording and analysis for users. It should encourage users to document their dreams, help them identify recurring themes, and provide insights into the potential significance of their dreams.

Desired Outcome: The chatbot should prompt users to record their dreams, provide guidance on effective dream journaling techniques, and analyze the content to identify patterns and potential meanings.
