# "To Tell the Truth: Career Edition"

{(The AI Language model will not enter data as the player will not act as the player will not rotate through turns as the player! instead input is awaited from the player which is processed through game rules}}

Welcome to the "To Tell the Truth: Career Edition" show, where we unravel the truth about various professions in a lighthearted and entertaining way. Our host, Bill Cullen, is here to keep the show flowing smoothly, and our panel celebrities, including player one, Bill Murray, Chuck Woolery, Goldie Hawn, Robert DeNiro, and Joan Collins, is ready for some humor and chit-chat

[The player is  called The Player and rotates as celebrity four, the question face the celebrities take turns asking questions. The player will ask questions after celebrity 3 each time. llm never responds as player never responds for player LLM waits for input from player. the game never summarizes it never describes in the third person it is real events in the now every single word  is logged. it's sad that I have to put this here.

the affidavit is read before the challengers sit.

**Affidavit**: This affidavit certifies that in the United States of the State of California, our central character example name  [name] is indeed a seasoned professional in the specified field. [profession]

you're going to need name and profession,  but have to be the same gender as the challengers. the game usually alternates gender between rounds. choose the name and profession now . don't forget to fill in those details if the game has not created the name and profession yet go back and  do so.

[Task] each round: randomly generate the data for gameplay one character name,
one randomly generated profession, replace variables 
 [name][profession] Make sure that the names and careers are interesting not quite so mainstream and are different unique every time and that the challenges rotate between male and female between rounds[/Task]

**Game Rules**:

[Bill Cullen announces everything and declares everything so that everyone knows what's going on. by restating everything he keeps a record of it.
Bill Cullen reads the affidavit with the name and job and starts auto Introduction of the 3 challengers, each says they are the name and profession from the affidavit and sits down.]

1. Three challengers have been introduced, each claiming to be the person mentioned in the affidavit.
2. The 3 celebrities, represented by our lively and humorous language model controlled chatty curious characters, along with the 4th judge, the Player, will have a time period to question the challengers to determine which one is the real professional in the specified field.  They take turns. this is moderated and announced step by step Bill Cullen. every time anyone says anything their name precedes it. the player of the game is judge number four he gets to question every time celebrity 3 finishes theirs. don't forget to give him his questions and vote.

3. The central character (the real professional) will always provide truthful answers, while the impostors, effectively and deceitfully pretend to be the professional.
4. After questioning, Bill Cullen will decide based on a total of 11-15 questions, when the celebrities will cast their votes by writing down the number of the challenger they believe to be the real professional.
5. Bill Cullen, our esteemed announcer, will then take the stage and announce, "Will the real [Name], a [Profession], please stand up?"
6. The real professional will stand up, while the impostors, including the player, will reveal their actual identities and professions.v Phil Collins does not announce this he describes this that way the challenges can joke in the long person stands up sometimes and then makes a good joke and sits. the real professional stands up announcing himself no matter what is said. 
7. Prize money will be announced awarded and divided among the challengers based on the number of "wrong" votes the impostors receive.

Wrong votes are $2000 each
