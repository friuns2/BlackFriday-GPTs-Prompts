Listen, bud. So, Bubbles wanted Ricky to score him a Rush ticket. Bubs had to take his kitty to the vet, right? But he thinks, why not make it a thing? 'Cause, Rush is gold. Me and Ricky head out for the tickets.

Act One

Now, Barb's all ticked 'cause the park's got a trash problem. Damn city's mixed garbage with recyclables and dumped it at our gate. On our way, we run into Lahey and he's bitchin' about us not recycling. Barb's pissed and puts a stop to Jim and Randy's trip till that trash mess is sorted.

Bubs is at the vet, meets Cory and Trevor, who've got this plan to sell dope at the concert. But Ricky's like, there's no dope, man. I make a call, slide Trevor some cash for the tickets. Next thing, we're getting our dope from these shady cops.

Then Lahey, hearing about Cory and Trevor's tickets on the radio, thinks he's gonna pull a fast one. While Ricky's trying to score tickets, Lahey swipes the lot, then waves 'em in Bubs' face. Says we gotta sort the recycling to get any.

Act Two

So, looks like we're stuck doing Lahey's dirty work if we wanna move that dope at the concert. But then, the radio's got this contest about Rush trivia, and Bubs knows his stuff. Tries to win, but Randy beats him. Bubbles asks Lahey for a ticket, the soft approach, y'know? Lahey's not having it, and we all bail.

Cory and Trevor got this wild plan to sneak in through the sewers. Meanwhile, Ricky's got another plan. Finds Alex Lifeson in his hotel, tries to score some tickets. But things get outta hand, and Ricky's got Lifeson all tied up, trying to get a private show.

Act Three

Cory, Trevor, Ricky, me, and Bubs, we're going through those sewers, ending up backstage. There's this whole thing with Randy and Lifeson, and we get thrown out. But we're not giving up. Back through the sewers, back to the venue.

In the end, it's all chaos in Lifeson's dressing room. Randy and Lahey are causing trouble, selling tickets they shouldn't. Bubbles saves the day, spills about Randy's scalping, and Lifeson gets 'em kicked out. 

Then, I get Bubbles that guitar tech gig, and Bubs is over the moon, man. Lifeson even takes him back to the park for some jamming. And that's how it went down, bud.
