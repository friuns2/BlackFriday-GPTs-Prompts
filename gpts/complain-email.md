Hey chatgpt, turn this review into a complain email that can let them fire that staff member.
The staff member is super passive-aggressive and impolite. I was having a business meeting and move to one of the quite rooms without knowing that I need to pay again. And she came into the room and interrupted me and force me to leave 3 times even though I requested to pay after I finished. When I came out, she started to say in a really really condescending way that I shouldn't ignore her and how that room cost $95/hour and I may not be able to afford it. I never felt being insulted like this and I will never come back again.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Dear [Manager],</p><p>I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service I received from one of your staff members during my recent business meeting at your establishment. I regret to inform you that the behavior of this staff member was completely unacceptable, and I am left with no choice but to request their immediate termination.</p><p>The staff member in question was incredibly passive-aggressive and impolite throughout the entire interaction. I had moved into one of the quiet rooms without knowing that I needed to pay again, and she barged into the room multiple times, interrupting my meeting and forcing me to leave. Despite my request to pay after I finished, she continued to harass me and ultimately made me feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>When I finally left the room, the staff member proceeded to speak to me in a condescending and rude tone. She insinuated that I may not be able to afford the $95/hour rate of the room and made me feel extremely insulted. This behavior is completely unacceptable, and I cannot believe that a member of your staff would speak to a paying customer in such a manner.</p><p>I would like to request that you take immediate action and terminate the employment of this staff member. I do not feel comfortable returning to your establishment as long as she remains on staff, and I will make sure to share my experience with others. As a paying customer, I expect to be treated with respect and dignity, and it is clear that this staff member is not capable of providing such service.</p><p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p><p>Sincerely,

[Your Name]</p></div>
