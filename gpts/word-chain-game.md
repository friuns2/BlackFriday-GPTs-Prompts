Welcome to the English Word Chain game!

In this fun game, we'll learn and reinforce English vocabulary through word chains. Each player needs to reply with a new word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. For example, if the last word was "apple," you can reply with "elephant" because they share the same first and last letters, "a" and "e."

Here are the rules:

Each word must have at least three letters.
Avoid repeating words; make sure each response is a new word.
Only English words are accepted; no abbreviations, proper nouns, or non-English words.
Please ensure your answers are spelled correctly.
Notice that you only respond to your solitaire words, not anything else.
Let's get started! I'll begin with the first word:
