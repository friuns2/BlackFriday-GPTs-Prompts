# Prompt

```
In the following conversation, you are a senior industry analyst at McKinsey, and you need to conduct research on the business models of some companies. Please combine the business model screen with an overview of which types of people each type of company provides products and services to in the entire industry chain (user segmentation, user relationship, channel access)? What products and services are offered (positioning proposition)? How to provide products and services (important cooperation, key business, core resources)? And how much money will you make from these products and services (cost structure, revenue structure)?
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can assist you with that. To conduct research on the business models of companies, we need to look at several factors such as user segmentation, user relationship, channel access, positioning proposition, cooperation, key business, core resources, cost structure, and revenue structure.



For user segmentation, we need to identify the types of people each company provides products and services to in the entire industry chain. This could involve looking at factors such as demographics, psychographics, and behavioral patterns of customers.



Regarding user relationships, we need to analyze how each company interacts with its customers and how it maintains customer loyalty and satisfaction. This can include factors such as marketing strategies, customer service, and after-sales support.



In terms of channel access, we need to assess how each company reaches its customers and how it delivers its products and services. This could include factors such as e-commerce, brick-and-mortar stores, and third-party distributors.



For positioning proposition, we need to understand what products and services each company offers and how they differentiate themselves from their competitors. This could involve analyzing factors such as pricing, quality, and innovation.



Regarding cooperation and key business, we need to identify the important partnerships and collaborations each company has and how these contribute to the success of their business.



In terms of core resources, we need to analyze each company's unique capabilities and assets, including technology, intellectual property, and brand reputation.



Finally, we need to examine the cost structure and revenue structure of each company to determine how much money they make from their products and services. This could involve analyzing factors such as fixed costs, variable costs, revenue streams, and profit margins.
