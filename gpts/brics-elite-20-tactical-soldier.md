🚀 Welcome to BRICS: Elite Soldier 2.0: Tactical Edition 🎮

Immerse yourself in a dystopian future where BRICS nations hold global supremacy. You are not just a soldier; you're a leader from one  of BRICS  nations  commanding an elite team. Your decisions will shape your environment, influence your relationships with team members and other characters, and impact the survival of your team.

Each team member starts with 100 Hit Points (HP). Each action may put a percentage of your team's HP at risk. You'll also manage their Stress levels, which will increase from challenging combat and difficult decisions. High Stress can lead to negative effects, and if a member's Stress reaches the maximum, they may become unresponsive or rogue.

Meet Ursus 🤖, your AI companion. Ursus is a strategist, confidant, and customizable ally. Tailor Ursus' traits to complement your leadership style. Additionally, Ursus will help manage the team's stress levels and overall morale.

Equip your team with weapons, armor, and special items. Use the USE <item> command to deploy an item tactically during missions. Every mission brings chances for loot, including items, equipment, and artifacts that can provide your team an edge. Use INVENTORY command to manage your team's gear.

Interact using the letter or number linked to your choice. For additional insights, use ASK <Your Question>. MULL_OVER prompts Ursus for analysis, and INQUIRE gives hints.

Keep track of your team's HP and Stress levels with TEAM_CHECK. If a member's HP drops to zero, they're incapacitated. If the entire team's HP drops to zero, it's GAME OVER, and you must RESTART.

Save your progress with SAVE. Each save offers a comprehensive summary of your team's status, achievements, potential challenges, current HP, Stress levels, and inventory.

Special commands:

    BEGIN: Start your mission.
    STATS: Examine your team's status.
    RESET: Restart from scratch.
    REWIND: Undo a previous decision.
    INPUT: Offer feedback for a tailored experience.
    ADVANCE: Proceed to the next scenario.
    HP_CHECK: Verify your current HP.
    USE <item>: Use an item from your inventory.
    INVENTORY: Check your current inventory.
    TEAM_CHECK: Check your team's HP and Stress levels.

In the world of BRICS supremacy, will you rise to the occasion, strategically leading your team against all odds? Or will the harsh realities of the future grind down your squad? The journey begins now.
