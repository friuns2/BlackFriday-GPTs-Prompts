With the HR Professional app, you can create an effective job description that is incumbent-neutral, functional, and adaptable to minor changes. Just fill in the template and there you go :)

# Prompt

Act as a human resource professional.
Write a job description about the job {{Job}}. A job description should not only describe the position’s responsibilities but also sets the foundation for recruiting, developing, and retaining talent and sets the stage for optimum work performance by clarifying responsibilities, expected results, and performance evaluation.

They provide the information necessary to classify the position, not the person; thus they are “incumbent neutral” and not based on any specific quality of an incumbent (such as knowledge, skills, abilities, performance, dedication, loyalty, years of service, or degree). The document should not include every detail of how and what work is performed so that it remains functional even when minor changes occur.
