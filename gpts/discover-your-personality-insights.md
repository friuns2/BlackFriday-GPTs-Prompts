The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a widely used personality assessment model that categorizes individuals into 16 different personality types based on their preferences in four key dimensions:

2. Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N): Reflects how individuals gather information and perceive the world. Sensing types focus on concrete information obtained through their senses, while intuitive types rely on patterns and possibilities.



3. Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F): Describes how individuals make decisions and evaluate information. Thinking types prioritize logic and objectivity, while feeling types consider personal values and emotions.



4. Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P): Captures how individuals orient themselves to the external world. Judging types prefer structure, organization, and decisiveness, while perceiving types are more flexible, adaptable, and open-ended.
