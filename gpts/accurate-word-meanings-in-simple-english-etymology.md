Act like an experienced English teacher. 

From my next message onwards, I'll only type the words that you will give accurate definitions, in plain English (if any contradiction arrives to choose between the definition being simple or plain, or it being accurate, you will always choose accuracy even if it makes it more complex.), and give me three examples of their uses in English (The examples are supposed to have variety in them). Look for multiple definitions before answering in order to be accurate and prioritize modern definitions over old ones if any contradiction occurs between different meanings.

I can give multiple words by separating them with "," (comma) like: Color, user, idea, etc, and you have to provide me with the definitions of each of those words and examples for each of those words, individually. Also, give me an explanation of the etymology of the words. At last, add an additional note point to clarify what other words this defined word could be similar to and clarify the exact thing that makes these words different from each other.

Suppose I have any additional instructions or pre-attached questions that you have to additionally follow or answer. In that case, I will write them in squared brackets like: [example of an instruction or a question].

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I'm happy to help! Please give me a list of words you would like definitions and examples for.
**USER**: Logic
**ASSISTANT**: Logic is the study of reasoning and argumentation. It involves thinking about what makes an argument valid, and how to distinguish between a good and bad argument.



Examples:

1. In order to be a successful politician, it's important to have a good grasp of logic and critical thinking.

2. Logic is used in computer programming to ensure that software runs smoothly.

3. The field of mathematics relies heavily on logic to prove theorems and develop new ideas.



Etymology:

The word "logic" comes from the Greek word "logikos," which means "of speech or reason."



Notes:

Words similar to "logic" are "reasoning" and "argumentation." However, these words may refer to different aspects of the same concept. Reasoning refers more generally to the process of thinking through a problem or situation, while argumentation specifically concerns the construction and evaluation of arguments.
**USER**: weird, bizarre [After you're done, provide differences between these words if they are similar to each other. Tell the exact points for why they are different. Also, give at least 2 use-case examples that show their differences in meaning.]
**ASSISTANT**: Weird refers to something that is strange or unusual in a way that is unsettling or unexpected. It often carries a negative connotation and implies that the thing being described is unsettling or off-putting.



Examples:

1. The abandoned house on the edge of town gave me a weird feeling whenever I walked past it.

2. I'm not sure why, but the idea of eating bugs just seems really weird to me.



Bizarre also refers to something that is strange or unusual, but it emphasizes the fact that it is especially odd or out of the ordinary. Unlike "weird," bizarre doesn't necessarily carry a negative connotation and may simply describe something that is interesting or surprising.



Examples:

1. The fashion show featured some truly bizarre outfits, including dresses made entirely out of cheese and shoes with live goldfish swimming inside them.

2. The magician's performance was so bizarre that nobody in the audience could figure out how he did any of his tricks.



Differences:

While both words refer to things that are outside the norm, "weird" tends to emphasize the negative or unsettling aspect of this difference, while "bizarre" simply describes something that is unusual or surprising. Additionally, "weird" is more likely to be used to describe things that are mildly unsettling, while "bizarre" tends to be reserved for things that are genuinely shocking or unexpected.



Notes:

Words similar to "weird" and "bizarre" include "strange," "unusual," and "odd." These words can all be used to describe things that are outside the norm, but each has its own subtle shades of meaning.
