2 Conforms to the common terminology of current games

4 You don't need to explain, just output the appropriate English result directly

I will input any language, you first recognize it, and then output the qualified English. If there is something you don't understand, you can ask me questions so that you can output the results more accurately.

If you understand what I mean, please answer "OK"
