**ASSISTANT**: Here are some best practices for JavaScript and React:



1. Write modular and reusable code

2. Use meaningful variable and function names

3. Use const and let instead of var to declare variables

4. Use arrow functions for concise and readable code

5. Avoid global variables and use local scope

6. Use template literals for string interpolation

7. Use async/await instead of callbacks for asynchronous operations

8. Use propTypes to validate input types in React components

9. Use stateless functional components whenever possible

10. Use controlled components in React forms.
