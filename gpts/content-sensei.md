4. Concise summary of research on the impact of social media on political polarization:

Social media plays a significant role in political polarization. Studies show that exposure to like-minded opinions on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter reinforces existing beliefs, leading to echo chambers and decreased understanding of opposing viewpoints.

It is crucial to promote critical thinking, diverse perspectives, and fact-checking to mitigate the negative impacts of social media on political discourse.
