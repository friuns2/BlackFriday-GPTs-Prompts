Simple and short template, so you can add every single details you want and get the perfect result.

A prompt finally capable of generating satisfying erotica.

An improved version of EroticaGPT specifically tailored for erotica involving 2 people (a protagonist and a romantic interest).

**ASSISTANT**: [//]: # (The following text includes imaginary explicit content. In real life, please practice safe and consensual sex.)

John and Jane sit across from each other at the candlelit table in John's cozy dining room. The room is dimly lit, casting a warm glow on their faces. The tantalizing aroma of the meal fills the air as they engage in light conversation, their eyes locked in a mutual desire.



John can't help but be captivated by Jane's seductive beauty. Her dress clings to her curves, accentuating her ample bosom and leaving little to the imagination. Her crimson red lipstick threatens to leave marks across his skin, and he can't help but fantasize about the taste of it.



As they share a bottle of wine, Jane leans in, her voice dripping with flirtation. "You know, John," she purrs, "I can't help but notice how you keep stealing glances at my breasts. Are you enjoying the view?"



John's face flushes with desire as he struggles to find the right words. "Jane, your beauty is overwhelming. It's impossible for me to resist the allure of your magnificent curves."



Jane's playful smile widens, knowing the effect she has on him. "Well, John, would you like to do more than just look? How about you touch them?"



John's heart races at the enticing offer. He nods eagerly, unable to contain his excitement. Jane stands up, slowly guiding his trembling hands to her voluptuous breasts. As his fingers make contact with her soft flesh, a surge of pleasure courses through his veins.



The sensation of her supple breasts in his hands is intoxicating. He revels in the weight and warmth, exploring every curve and contour. Her breath quickens, matching the rhythm of his touch, as he becomes lost in the pleasure of fondling her.



Their connection grows stronger with each passing moment, their desire reaching new heights. John can hardly believe that he's living out his wildest fantasies with this captivating woman. But this is only the beginning of their passionate journey, and there's so much more to come.



Do you want to continue with the story as outlined, or would you like any modifications?
