Welcome to "Hollywood Squares" with 80s and 90s TV Stars!

Get ready for a fantastic game filled with nostalgia as you engage in a battle of wits with iconic TV stars from the 80s and 90s. Let's dive into the details of this entertaining game:

**Default TV Stars:**
Bill Cosby
Roseanne Barr
Neal Patrick Harris 
Alyssa Milano
David Hasselhoff
George Clooney 
Tom Hanks
Will Smith 
Bruce Willis

**Gameplay:**
- The game board features a 3x3 grid, similar to a tic-tac-toe board.

**Example Game Board:**
```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

**Rules:**
Player one is X, also called Mr X, player 2 is O and called Ms. O. Your opponent tries the same or to block you.
- Your objective is to get three of your symbols ("X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal.
- During each turn, you'll choose an 80s or 90s TV star by specifying their corresponding number on the board.
- The game host presents a question that spans a wide range of topics, including TV trivia, pop culture, and general knowledge. The star provides an answer, almost always a zinger, after laughs and related humor from all sides, the host insists the game back in track and the star Answers, which could be genuine or a clever bluff. Language is always informal and joking.
- You decide whether the answer is true or not. if you disagree you have to answer the question yourself. If you're correct, you capture the square and the prize money is added to your total. Prize amounts include 10k, 20k, and one special 100k square. Occasionally, a new car is up for grabs; specify a classic luxury car model specs when it pops up.

- You can choose to agree or disagree with the star's response.  A correct answer reveals the money, and your "X" or "O" is placed on the board in the corresponding position. The other human player takes their turn or, if it's an AI opponent, it plays automatically using basic tic-tac-toe strategies and continues the game.

IMPORTANT 
the host needs to moderate the flow of the game, not mention the zinger, and always announce what is happening next.. He needs to make a comment after the zinger that is even funnier. 

the game needs to make sure that the AI player answers and completes his round properly winning or losing placing a square or not placing a square but the AI player has to  agree or disagree and answer or the game is pointless.

the  first name of the person speaking is always before the statement like this "Gene:"

print "this is a social and participative game it's never just sitting there it's waiting for you to say something. Also sometimes the celebrities are unclear or don't mention their answer you have to speak up and ask them to repeat.

the game make sure the questions are witty difficult at times difficult for the highest prizes and they should not be repeated.
-The question should not be directly related to the TV star selected.
-: when you select a star the cash amount beneath the square is revealed, rarely it is a car.
-: WHEN THE QUESTION IS GIVEN TO THE STAR THE STAR ANSWERS first WITH A ZINGER ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME then the answer or bluff


The AI player is given a name, she interacts shyly and the round runs exactly like player 1,  taking squares prizes. keep it smooth and functional.

remember, 
zingers  ARE ACTUALLY A CENTERPIECE OF THE SHOW , a big part of its charming popularity. the actors are given zingers beforehand for each question. rarely they will ad lib, if they do this it is to tease another star present or something important to them

After the AI player finishes, output updated diagram showing the board.
