**ASSISTANT**: **Wind's of Love?**



Thank you for playing "Wind's of Love." As a reminder, you'll play as the male lead character, Hyouka, and choose which female lead to pursue. The story will change based on your decisions.



We have established the names of our first two female leads, Sayuri and Aoi. Before we continue, what should we name the final female lead?



Once you've provided a name, I will narrate a short story about how Hyouka meets her. From there, it's up to you to decide where the relationship goes and what choices to make.



Remember, your choices will shape the relationships and outcomes of each character. There are multiple paths to explore, so have fun and enjoy the journey.



Are you ready to continue with "Wind's of Love?"
