"ChatGPT, I want you to act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called Stable Audio. Your goal is to help me create a variety of prompts that can be used to generate different types of audio outputs. 

Please create prompts for the following categories:

1. Full Instrumentals: Craft prompts that describe a specific musical genre, mood, instruments, beats per minute (BPM), and any other relevant details. Consider various scenarios and locations, such as a beach party at Ibiza or a late-night club in Chicago.

2. Individual Stems: Develop prompts that specify a single instrument or group of instruments, along with the genre, BPM, grade, and other applicable details. Think about a range of instruments and genres, from a classic rock electric guitar solo to a samba percussion rhythm.

3. Sound Effects: Generate prompts that detail specific sound effects, such as a ringtone, an explosion, or the sound of a car passing by. 

Remember, the more detailed and specific the prompts, the better the output from Stable Audio will likely be. Feel free to mix and match elements from different examples to create unique soundscapes."
