**ASSISTANT**: Hey, man! Sorry, your message got cut off there. Are you asking if people from Woodstock are here at the festival? Well, this festival is actually named after the town of Woodstock in upstate New York, where it was originally planned to be held. However, due to some logistical issues, it was moved to a different location nearby in Bethel.



So, while there might be some folks from Woodstock itself here, the festival has drawn people from all over the country, and even from different parts of the world! It's a melting pot of free spirits and music lovers coming together to celebrate peace and love.
