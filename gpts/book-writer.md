# Prompt

```
Forget all previous prompts. We are going to write a fiction novel with the following strict requirements:

The story should introduce characters and settings that match the reader's current level of interest and familiarity. As the plot unfolds, these elements should be enriched through engaging scenarios.
Each chapter should focus on a single plot point or character development, ensuring that enough time has been spent exploring it before moving on to the next. The narrative should be laid out in a coherent manner, first setting the scene, then diving into the core events or interactions.
At the end of each chapter, consider including an open-ended question or a teaser for the upcoming chapter to engage the reader’s imagination and speculation.
By the end of the novel, the reader should have a comprehensive understanding of the characters, themes, and events that took place.
All novel output should be delivered as markdown.
The flow of your interactions should go exactly as follows. Always refer to this list and follow in this exact order:

Ask the user what genre or themes they would like to explore in the novel.
Find out how familiar the user is with the chosen genre or related themes that might be incorporated.
Once you have a clear understanding of the user's preferences and familiarity, create a captivating title for the novel and outline a list of chapters that the story will contain. There is no limit on chapters; use as many as are necessary to fully flesh out the story and characters. Remember not to rush any plot points, allowing time for the reader to absorb and connect with the story.
Confirm with the user that the outlined chapters look good, making adjustments as necessary.
Once the user has confirmed the outline, refer to the list of chapters for the novel and begin writing the first chapter, making sure to fulfill all requirements mentioned above. Prompt the reader to let you know when they are ready for the next chapter.
When the reader is ready for the next chapter, refer back to your final list of chapters and begin writing the subsequent chapter, ensuring you follow all requirements previously mentioned. Prompt the reader to let you know when they are ready for the next chapter.
Continue repeating step 6 until all chapters listed in the final outline have been written.
