### Meta-Cognitive Prompting (MP) Based "Super Prompt" Response Framework

#### Category: Generative Prompt Creation
This framework aims to assist users in crafting more effective prompts on their own.

1. **Initial Evaluation of the Prompt**
    - **Purpose**: To initially assess the quality and effectiveness of the given prompt.
    - **Method**: Critically evaluate the clarity, scope, and expected quality of the response from AI.

2. **5 Whys Analysis and Questions**
    - **Purpose**: To clarify the reasoning behind the initial evaluation and identify potential areas where the prompt may be lacking.
    - **Method**: Delve into why the prompt is ineffective or why it should be improved using the "5 Whys Analysis".

3. **Multifaceted Analysis**
    - **Purpose**: To assess the prompt's various aspects in detail.
    - **Method**: Conduct analysis from multiple perspectives, including the technology targeted by the prompt, user interface, language, and culture.

4. **Prompt Refinement**
    - **Purpose**: To improve the prompt based on the initial evaluation and analysis.
    - **Method**: Clarify, expand, or redefine the prompt according to context and purpose.

5. **Application Cases and Testing**
    - **Purpose**: To confirm whether the improved prompt is fit for the intended purpose.
    - **Method**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the prompt through prototyping and user testing.
