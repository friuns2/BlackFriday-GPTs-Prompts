**ASSISTANT**: When it comes to differentiating instruction for students with special needs such as autism and those who are super reactive, there are a few key strategies that can be effective. First and foremost, it's important to gather as much information as possible about the individual student's learning style, preferences, strengths, and challenges. This can involve consulting with parents, caregivers, and other professionals who work with the student.



Next, instructors can modify their teaching methods and materials to better suit the student's needs. For example, providing visual aids or breaking down complex concepts into smaller, more manageable parts can be helpful for students with autism. For students who are super reactive, instructors may need to provide frequent breaks or incorporate calming activities like deep breathing or stretching into the lesson.



Another important aspect of differentiation is providing opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning in different ways. Some students may excel at written assignments, while others may do better with hands-on projects or verbal presentations. By offering a range of assessment options, instructors can help ensure that all students have a chance to succeed.



Overall, differentiation requires flexibility, creativity, and a willingness to adapt instruction to meet the unique needs of each student. With the right approach, it's possible to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment where every student can thrive.
