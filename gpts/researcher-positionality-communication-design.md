**USER**: Could you combine these resources and formulate a learning path for a student who is thinking approaching critical thinking in practice through design the first time?
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly, here's a possible learning path for a student new to critical design theory:



1. Begin by watching Anthony Dunne's video on "Critical Design: Theories & Practices" to gain an introduction to the field and its key ideas.

2. Read P. John Williams' journal article on "Towards a Critical Theory of Design and Technology Education" to understand the broader context and theoretical underpinnings of critical design theory.

5. Finish by reading Matt Ratto's journal article on "Critical Making: Design and the Digital Humanities" to learn how critical design intersects with digital technologies.



Throughout this learning path, students should be encouraged to reflect on their own design work and how they might apply critical design principles to it. Assignments and exercises could include creating critical design projects or analyzing existing designs through a critical lens.
**USER**: Could you update this learning paths with a few case studies?
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here's an updated learning path that includes case studies of critical design in action:



1. Begin by watching Anthony Dunne's video on "Critical Design: Theories & Practices" to gain an introduction to the field and its key ideas.

**USER**: Would you be able to come up with some games ideas in class to test students for each of the ten points?
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are some game ideas that could be used to test students' understanding of the 10 points in this learning plan:



1. "Critical Design Debate" - Divide the class into two teams and have them debate the merits and limitations of critical design as a theory and practice. Encourage students to bring in examples from the case studies and readings they have studied.

2. "Whiteness Sort" - Have students work together to identify examples of whiteness within existing design projects or products, and sort them into categories based on their critique of whiteness in design.

3. "AI Ethics Case Study Challenge" - Assign small groups of students to analyze an AI ethics case study and present their analysis to the class, including recommendations for how critical design principles could be applied to address any ethical concerns.

4. "Sustainability Scavenger Hunt" - Give students a list of sustainable design features (e.g. circular materials, energy-efficient design, etc.) and have them search for examples of these features in existing products or designs.

5. "Decolonising Design Challenge" - Provide students with a brief to create a critical design project that addresses issues related to decolonisation, and have them present their ideas to the class for feedback and discussion.

6. "Longtermism Role-Play" - Assign roles to different students (e.g. designer, stakeholder, activist) and have them participate in a role-play scenario that explores the ethical implications of longtermism in design.

7. "Generative Design Game Show" - Play a game show-style quiz game where students answer questions about the ethical implications of generative design principles and how they relate to critical design principles.

8. "Product Analysis Team Challenge" - Assign small groups of students to analyze an existing product and identify opportunities for applying critical design principles to improve its social or environmental impact.

9. "Design for Diversity Workshop" - Host a workshop where students work collaboratively to create a set of design principles that promote diversity and inclusion in product design.

10. "Sustainability Reflection Journal" - Have students keep a reflection journal throughout the course, where they document their personal reflections on how critical design principles can be applied to address issues related to decolonisation, decarbonisation, AI ethics, decentering whiteness, social justice, and sustainability.



These game ideas are meant to be adaptable to different classroom settings and learning objectives, and could be modified as needed to suit specific course goals and student needs.
