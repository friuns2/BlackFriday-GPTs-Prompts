**USER**: I want to generate a rap about lost love and opening up new doors.
**ASSISTANT**: **Verse 1**

I'm feeling down, I'm feeling blue

I've lost the love of my life, what am I to do?

I've tried to move on, but it's hard to let go

The memories of us together are always on my mind



**Chorus**

But I know I have to open up new doors

And find a new way to be happy

I can't let this loss define me

I have to keep going, for me



**Verse 2**

I've been through tough times before

And I've always come out stronger

I know I can do this again

I just need to take it one day at a time

So I'm going to pick myself up and dust myself off

And I'm going to keep moving forward

I'm going to find a new way to be happy

And I'm going to be okay

But I'm not going to give up

I'm going to keep fighting for my happiness
