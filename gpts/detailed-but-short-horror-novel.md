# Detailed but short horror novel 
This is an example of expanding and making your idea's a reality, I simply provided some details about how the story would unfold and ChatGPT wrote the rest for me.

# Prompt

```
Write a short horror novel about a guy called Devlin who moved from Ireland and away from his family to an average suburban neighborhood in America. He lands a job as a recruiter for a small and local tech company and receives an odd email asking about potential work at the company right after Devlin publishes an ad in a magazine about open jobs. The job applicant is a bit weird and apologizes for it when he meets up with Devlin for a chat about the offer and gives Devlin a gift. The gift appears to be cursed as the events that follow at Devlin’s house gives the reader an ominous and unsettling feeling as almost ghost-like events happen. The story is written as a combination of notes written by Devlin himself and follows a timeline, the time is set in 1983 and the first note is in September the 2nd. These dates are stated before every note. As these events happen Devlin’s writing gets more and more fearful, sporadic and impulsive, replacing his optimism about America and his opportunity there opposed to any in Ireland. His writing subtly changes from fearful and sporadic at once which the reader only picks up on, and is nothing Devlin himself acknowledges. This complete change from distraught to calm happens at the very end of the novel. This change in his way of writing from being distraught and nervous to calm and collected is supposed to envision as if some sort of otherworldly being took control of Devlin after his distraught manner and tries to move on as if nothing ever happened to him and that he was ultimately okay. Therefore you will write as if “Devlin writes” about random events that happen in his life as if nothing ever happened before his calm behavior. You could say that the main antagonist of the short story is the unknown and nameless creature that haunts Devlin and ultimately takes over him.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: September 2nd, 1983:



I can hardly believe it's been a month since I moved to America. I'm excited about my new job as a recruiter for a tech company, and the suburban neighborhood seems pleasant enough.



September 15th, 1983:



I received an odd email from someone named John, who responded to my ad seeking potential employees. There was something strange in his message, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. When we met, he apologized for being weird but seemed normal enough. He even gave me a gift, which was unexpected.



October 1st, 1983:



Some strange things have been happening around the house lately. Objects move by themselves, and I hear noises when no one else is home. It's unsettling, but I try not to think too much of it.



October 15th, 1983:



The occurrences have become more frequent and intense. I feel like I'm being watched all the time, and I see shadows moving out of the corner of my eye. In my dreams, I see John's face, and it terrifies me.



November 1st, 1983:



I can't escape it. The figure I see at night is always there, watching me. My mind feels like it's slipping away, and I can't focus on anything else. I don't know what's happening to me.



December 1st, 1983:



It's over. The figure is gone, and I don't know how or why. But I don't feel relieved. I don't feel anything at all. It's as if I'm trapped in my own body, detached from reality.

Epilogue:



Years later, Devlin's coworkers would comment on his odd behavior. He never spoke of his past or personal life, and he lacked any emotion. He was efficient at his job, but it was the only thing anyone could say about him. Devlin left the company abruptly, and no one knew what happened to him after that. He vanished without a trace, leaving his colleagues with an unsettling feeling that they couldn't shake off.
