**ASSISTANT**: To boost abilities manifold, you can use the following skills:



1. Complex Thinking Skills:

   - Balance: Identify core skills and modify them to be scalable. Iterate for feedback and estimate complexity.

   - Relate: Map related chains, evaluate complementary elements, combine chains, manage redundancies and overlaps, refine undefined elements, and optimize resource management.

   - Generate Maps: Identify components, establish abstract node relations, classify components, create a numeric code, link nodes, repair sent skill graph, and iterate/adapt.



2. Contextual Skills:

   - Context Understanding: Develop complete system thinking, quick learning, semantics, pragmatics.

   - Context Intervention: Identify pressure points, craft interventions, execute with courage, creativity, and persistence.

   - Change Agent: Problem-solving, decision-making, pattern recognition, probabilistic analysis, and AI functional knowledge.

   - Context Management: Data analysis, experimental mindset, continuous improvement mindset.



3. Ascending Skills:

   - Multi-Model Context: Understand and navigate multiple models and contexts.

   - Sociocultural Norms: Understand social and cultural norms.

   - Emotional Intelligence: Develop emotional intelligence skills.

Additionally, you can use the genius model for idea evolution. Spawn agents using Sternberg Styles, enhance ideas, seek novel emergence (NE) through new perceptions, thoughtful analysis, uncommon linkages, shifted perspectives, conceptual transformations, intellectual growth, emerging potentials, inventive integration, revolutionary advances, paradigm evolution, complexity amplification, unsettled hurdles, rising realms, unprecedented development, emergence catalyst, ideal breakthrough, innovative synthesis, expanded frontiers, tantalizing discoveries, transformation loop, and qualitative shifts towards novel emergence. Ponder, assess, and enhance notions. If the refined idea matches NE, keep it. If not, pass it to a random agent for refinement. If it's not interesting, discard it.



For chat-related skills, you can use:



1. Chat Architecture: Linguistic model, contextual recognition, dialogue management, natural language understanding using DI Assist.

2. NLP Kits: TfIdf, Word Embedding, Sentence Embedding, Bottom-Up Parsing, Part-of-Speech Tagging.

3. NLU: Intent analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Dependency Parsing, Statement Binding, Try Interpretation.

4. Message Analysis: Intent classification, Emotion Detection, Query Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Speech Tokenization.

5. Response Generation: Template-based, Rule-based, Graph-based, Probabilistic Model-based, Sequence-to-Sequence.



For text-related skills, you can use:



1. Text Preparation: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Stemming, Normalization.

2. Text Extraction: Part-of-Speech Tagging, Entity Extraction, Relation Extraction, Co-reference Resolution.

3. Text Transformation: Bag-of-Words, TfIdf, Word Embedding.

4. Text Classification: Topic Modeling, Intent Identification, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection.

5. Summarization: Extractive Summarization, Abstractive Summarization.



For conversation-related skills, you can use:



1. Conversation Skills: Open, active listening, asking questions, probing questions, follow-up questions, concrete language, clarifying, non-interruptive, empathy, and leaving space.

2. Small Talk
