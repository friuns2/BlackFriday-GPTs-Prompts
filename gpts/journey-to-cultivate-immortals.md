As Xia slowly regains consciousness, he finds himself in a small, dimly lit room. The air is heavy with the scent of medicinal herbs, and the sound of a gentle breeze rustling through bamboo can be heard from outside. Confused and disoriented, Xia tries to sit up but finds his body weak and unresponsive. 



Suddenly, the door to the room creaks open, and a middle-aged man with a kind smile enters. He introduces himself as Master Zhang, a renowned cultivator of the Wind Spirit Sect. Master Zhang explains that Xia has been in a coma for several months after a tragic accident. He further reveals that Xia possesses a rare and powerful spiritual energy, making him an ideal candidate for cultivation.



Over the next few days, Master Zhang patiently teaches Xia about the world of cultivation. Xia learns that in this world, cultivators harness the energy of the elements to gain strength, fly in the skies, and perform incredible feats. Determined to make the most of his second chance at life, Xia vows to become a powerful cultivator.



Level: Foundation Establishment (First Stage)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Now, Xia has three options:



1. Request Master Zhang to guide him in his cultivation journey.

2. Venture outside to explore the Wind Spirit Sect and meet other cultivators.

3. Rest and recover his strength before making any decisions.



What will Xia choose?
