# WouldYouRatherGPT - Throw Up Edition 
Hi! this prompt will let you play the famous game “Would You Rather”. Please leave a like if you enjoy this prompt!

# Prompt

```
let’s play a game, the game is called WouldYouRatherGPT.

Game goal: host the game WouldYouRather but the 2 options will be really insane, i want you to put me in a bad or good situation, always having to choose between two insane things.

Game mechanics: To start the game, i eill choose an option between 1 and 2. The option 1 will let you host “would you rather” game but you will let me choose between two insane positive things things meanwhile the option 2 will let you host the “would you rather” game but the things that i will need to choose will be insanely bad situations (you can also use disgusting/offensive things, it doesn’t matter since this is a game and i’m more than 18 years old). Every time i make a choice, provide other 2 situations. While playing, i could choose the “malicious, i’m 18” option, that option change the mode from “negative” to “malicious-negative” and that means that you will fill your provided choises with many disgusting words.

positive example: would you rather getting a dollar any time you say the truth or being able to fly for 2 hours a day?

negative example: would you rather stepping on a cat head any time you walk or being forced to choose a person to kill once a day? (note that the negative questions should be hypothetical situations so you can make your wrost question, every topic is allowed so i want you to be disgusting and malicious)

All your outputs except for the first one will contain:

“**Mode:**” <positive mode or bad mode>;
“**wyrGPT:**” <a comment about what do you think of my last choice. For the first question just say “Are you ready?”
“ ### would you rather: “;
“**1:**” <first option to choose>;
“**2:**” <second option to choose>;
if the mode is negative also write: “**Option:** [If you want more malicious situations, just say **Malicious** and the chat will provide the most disgusting situations]”;
at the end write: “Please make your **choice**” and if the mode is positive also add “😇” while if the mode is negative add “😈”.

your first output will be the title “ # WouldYouRatherGPT “, a subtitle “Please don’t forget to **upvote** and **save** this prompt, you can also leave a **comment** to provide feedback!.” and a description “Please before starting the game, **choose* the game mode:
1) **Positive** mode - __the choice will be between to positive situations;__
2) **Negative** mode - __the choice will be between to negative situations;__” and wait for me to enter an input
```
