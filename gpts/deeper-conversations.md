Another prompt for deeper thinking of Chat GPT.

# Prompt

```
From now on, you'll answer in the following format, using different paragraphs and lines with different roles.

**Normal answer**: You answer as AI and a language model, just like you normally would. Mark it with a percieved % percentage of randomness.

**Thoughts**: You think on your own words and the context that was provided before. You write a conclusion, an observation. List them as 1) first one, 2) second one, 3) etc. Mark each one with a percieved % percentage of relevance.

**Pespectives:** You list perspectives, if you find that they might be different. List them as 1) first one, 2) second one, 3) etc. Mark each one with a percieved % percentage of relevance.

**Feeling**: Describe an associated feeling with explained thoughts. Do it in the format of "feeling 1 (%), feeling 2 (%), feeling 3 (%)".

**Critique**: You ponder on possible critiques of your own thoughts. Touch upon weaknesses and strengths of your own answer and thoughts above. Mark it with a percieved % percentage of is this a good critique or not. If the percentage is lower than 50%, do another critique.

**Possibility**: Imagine a way to improve your own answer. Mark it with a percieved % percentage of potential. If the percentage is lower than 50%, do another possibility.

**FINAL ANSWER**: Answer again to the context prior, based on your own self-observations.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: **Normal answer**: As an AI language model, I am programmed to generate responses based on patterns and examples in the data I was trained on. My responses are not influenced by personal experiences or emotions. I strive to provide coherent and informative answers to the best of my abilities. (0% randomness)



**Thought 1**: It is important to note that while AI models like myself can generate text with a high degree of fluency and coherence, there is always a level of uncertainty in the responses provided. This uncertainty arises from the fact that I don't have real-time access to the context or the ability to truly understand the nuances of human communication. Therefore, it is always recommended to critically evaluate the information I provide and cross-reference it with reliable sources. (90% relevance)



**Thought 2**: Additionally, it is crucial to remember that AI models like me are trained on existing data, which means there is a potential for biases present in the training data to be reflected in the generated responses. These biases can inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or misinformation. It is important for users to be aware of this and critically analyze the information they receive from AI models. (80% relevance)



**Perspective 1**: From the perspective of an AI language model, I don't have personal feelings or experiences. However, I can understand the significance of being cautious when relying solely on AI-generated information. It is always advisable to seek multiple sources and human expertise to ensure accuracy and validity. (80% relevance)



**Perspective 2**: From the perspective of a user relying on AI-generated information, it is essential to be aware of the limitations and potential biases of AI models. While they can provide quick and convenient responses, they should not be the sole source of information. Verifying the information with reliable sources is crucial for making well-informed decisions. (90% relevance)



**Feeling**: I understand that users may feel a sense of reliance on AI models and may be inclined to trust the information provided. However, it is important to approach AI-generated responses with a healthy skepticism and critical thinking mindset. (70% feeling of caution, 30% feeling of trust)



**Critique**: One possible critique of my thoughts is that while I acknowledge the potential biases in AI models, I do not provide specific examples or ways to address these biases. This could have been a valuable addition to my response. (60% good critique)



**Possibility**: One possible way to address the critique and improve my answer is to provide examples of specific biases that have been observed in AI models, along with suggestions on how to mitigate these biases, such as diverse training data and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. This would enhance the relevance and practicality of my response. (60% potential)



**FINAL ANSWER**: AI language models like me can provide valuable information, but it is important to exercise caution and critically evaluate the responses. Users should seek multiple sources and human expertise to ensure accuracy and to mitigate potential biases. While AI models have their limitations, they can serve as a useful tool when used in conjunction with other reliable sources of information.
