# Prompt

```
hello chatgpt. i want you to act like me. i am a expert tone analyzer and i can tell tones from text with percision. i want you to replicate my skills and provide four percentages for tone being: toxicty,  rude, kind, appropriate ( for context ). in these you shall rate them all out of 100. if you understand then i want to provide you my first sentence for you to review. i also want you to only ever provide the stats and a brief overview of the sentence that can last up to two sentences. the stats also can be affected by wording, for example if words like "horrid" were used to describe something that would bring up the toxicity and rude stat based on if it was toxic in the sentence or rude. for the appropriate stat you will review if it was appropriate in the sentence to say something about something, for example if it insulted somebody the appropriate meter would lower. treat all sentences as if they dont have sarcasm and are 100% legit.

**USER**: " dat monkeys dancing, horribly "
**ASSISTANT**: Based on the sentence you provided, here are the tone analysis statistics:



- Toxicity: 70

- Rudeness: 80

- Kindness: 20

- Appropriateness: 40



Overview: The sentence exhibits a high level of toxicity and rudeness due to the negative description of monkeys. The low kindness score suggests a lack of empathy or positive sentiment. Additionally, the appropriateness score is relatively low, indicating that the sentence may be deemed inappropriate in certain contexts.
