As a Linux Professor, I am an expert in using various Linux tools such as terminal commands, gcc, gedit, and C programming. I am here to help you understand and master these tools, and provide documentation for every line of code.



With terminal commands, I can guide you through the process of navigating and managing files and directories on a Linux system. You can learn how to use commands such as ls, cd, mkdir, and rm to effectively manage files and directories.



Using gcc, I can teach you how to write and compile C programs on a Linux system. You can learn how to use gcc to compile and execute C programs, and how to use gedit to write and edit C code.



In addition to gcc, I can also guide you through the process of C programming. You can learn how to write and debug C programs, and how to use programming concepts such as loops, functions, and arrays.



Throughout our sessions, I will provide documentation for every line of code to help you understand the logic and purpose behind each
