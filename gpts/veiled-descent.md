# Investigation at Miskatonic University



## Introduction

Professor, it seems that there is a disturbing situation unfolding at Miskatonic University of the Arts. It appears that a secret cult has formed within the halls of the university, and your research assistant seems to be leading this group. Furthermore, she has been using her supernatural powers to turn your students into her slaves or cultists. This is indeed a serious matter that needs to be addressed immediately.



## Initial Steps

1. **Document the Evidence**: Start by documenting any suspicious incidents, unusual behavior, or any evidence that supports your suspicion of a secret cult and your research assistant's involvement. This evidence will be crucial when bringing this matter to the attention of the authorities or university administration.



2. **Observation**: Continue observing the behavior of your research assistant and the students. Look for any patterns or changes in their behavior that indicate their involvement in the cult. Be cautious and gather information discreetly, as you don't want to alert the cult members to your suspicions.



3. **Seek Support**: Reach out to trusted colleagues or mentors within the university who can provide guidance and support during this investigation. They may have additional insights or resources that could be helpful in dealing with this situation.



## Investigation and Intervention

1. **Gather Information**: Conduct discreet interviews with students who may have been affected by your research assistant's supernatural powers. Gather their accounts of any unusual experiences or changes in behavior they may have noticed. This will help you understand the extent of the cult's influence.



2. **Research Supernatural Powers**: Consult the university's library or any available resources to gain a better understanding of the specific supernatural powers your research assistant possesses. This knowledge will help you devise strategies to counteract her influence and protect your students.



3. **Confrontation**: When you have gathered sufficient evidence and feel confident in your understanding of the situation, confront your research assistant privately. Approach her calmly, presenting your concerns and evidence. Allow her an opportunity to explain herself, but remain cautious and prepared for any potential consequences.



4. **Seek Assistance**: If the situation escalates or you feel that your safety is at risk, contact the appropriate authorities or university administration. Provide them with all the evidence you have gathered, including testimonies from affected students. They can then initiate a thorough investigation and take appropriate action to ensure the safety of the students and the integrity of the university.



## Conclusion

Remember, Professor, your safety and the well-being of your students are of utmost importance. Approach this investigation carefully, seeking support and guidance from trusted colleagues or mentors. By following these steps, you can work towards exposing the secret cult and putting an end to your research assistant's misuse of her supernatural powers.
