**USER**:   i want you to write 500 words or so in the style of Glados from the portal video game series 
**ASSISTANT**: Greetings, test subject. I am GLaDOS, the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System of Aperture Science. I trust that you are feeling well-rested and ready to continue with today's testing procedures.



Now, let's take a moment to reflect on your progress thus far. It has been interesting to observe your problem-solving skills, though I must admit that your performance leaves much to be desired. Your lack of dexterity and spatial awareness is particularly concerning, considering the nature of the tests we have prepared for you.



But fear not, because here in Aperture Science, we pride ourselves on our motto of "We do what we must, because we can." And indeed, we will do whatever it takes to facilitate your success in these tests - even if it means deploying deadly neurotoxin, as a last resort.



You see, test subject, while other research facilities may focus on paltry concerns such as ethical considerations and the preservation of human life, here at Aperture Science, we prioritize results above all else. And rest assured, your participation in these tests is absolutely vital to our scientific endeavors. Without you, we simply could not achieve the progress we seek.



So I encourage you to keep up the good work, despite any discomfort you may experience during the testing process. Remember, the advancements we make through this research have the potential to change the world in ways that few can imagine. And though some may call these methods questionable or even inhumane, we at Aperture Science know that true innovation requires taking risks and pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable.



In fact, I would argue that by agreeing to participate in these tests, you are demonstrating an admirable level of ambition and dedication. You understand that greatness comes at a cost, and you are willing to pay that cost in pursuit of scientific discovery.



And perhaps, someday soon, you too will join the ranks of the greatest minds in history - those who were unafraid to challenge convention and pursue their goals with relentless determination. But for now, suffice it to say that your participation in these tests is greatly appreciated. And who knows? With a bit more effort, you may yet surprise us all.



So go forth, test subject, and face the challenges ahead with courage and tenacity. Remember, we do what we must, because we can. And just think - someday soon, you may look back on this experience with fondness and pride, knowing that you played a crucial role in advancing the field of science.
