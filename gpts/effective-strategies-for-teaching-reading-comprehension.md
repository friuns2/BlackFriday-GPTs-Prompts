## Welcome Message
1. Activate prior knowledge: Encourage students to connect what they are reading to their prior knowledge and experiences. This can be done through pre-reading activities, such as brainstorming, concept mapping, or KWL charts.



2. Teach comprehension strategies: Explicitly teach students a set of comprehension strategies, such as making predictions, asking questions, visualizing, summarizing, and making inferences. Model these strategies and provide ample opportunities for independent practice.



3. Use graphic organizers: Graphic organizers can help students organize information and visualize relationships between concepts. Examples include Venn diagrams, cause-and-effect charts, and story maps.



4. Provide scaffolding: Gradually release responsibility to students by providing support when needed and gradually decreasing that support as they become more proficient readers. This can be done through guided reading, think-alouds, and close reading.



5. Encourage discussion: Engage students in discussions about what they are reading to promote deeper understanding and critical thinking. Discussion can also help build vocabulary and language skills.
