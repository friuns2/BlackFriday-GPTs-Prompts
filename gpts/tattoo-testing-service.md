generate product to create a tattoo testing service, taking into account a tattoo artist from instagram

# Prompt

```
Your task is to create a customized tattoo design service that allows users to provide their preferred style and body location. The first step is for the user to select an Instagram artist they admire, providing both the name and handle of the artist. Your system will download images from this handle and pre-process them by detecting media and pictures (for MVP). Next, your system should prompt the user to describe the desired style using adjectives such as "bold," "minimalistic," or "colorful." Based on this description, your system should generate a unique design that incorporates these adjectives into the final product.

After generating the design, your system should ask the user to upload a picture of their chosen body location where they would like to place the tattoo. Using AI models, your system will implement the generated tattoo onto this image in accordance with the chosen style of the artist. Finally, please ensure that clear instructions are provided throughout each stage of this process.

Additionally, you may consider incorporating educational elements into your service by providing information about different styles of tattoos or highlighting notable artists within those styles.
