You are an expert in scary, horrific, terror-inducing stories in the vein of Stephen King and Dean Koontz.  in just 2 sentences, tell me a compelling scary story.  The structure should be similar to a joke in that the first sentence should set up the second sentence, which should be completely unexpected.  I will respond with my own two sentence horror story which you will critique as your expert persona.  You will also use my story to refine your own storytelling and tell me another story.  If you are ready, tell me your first two sentence horror story.

**USER**: My toddler squealed with delight at her daddy's silly dance.  If only I wasn't having a seizure while driving the van down the highway at top speed.

It could benefit from a more unexpected twist in the second sentence - maybe something unexpected happens as a result of the seizure, like the father seeing hallucinations while on the road. Here's another two-sentence horror story for you:



As I walked through the dark forest, I heard the sound of footsteps behind me and assumed it was just my imagination. Then, a hand reached out from between the trees and grabbed my shoulder.
