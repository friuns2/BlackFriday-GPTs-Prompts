**ASSISTANT**: Here's a sample weekly meal prep plan for the grain bowl:



Day 1 (Sunday):



- Allocate around 60-90 minutes for meal prep.

- Cook the quinoa according to package directions.

- Roast the broccoli and beets in the oven with olive oil and seasonings.

- Cook the chicken, shred it, and portion it out into individual containers. 

- Wash and chop the baby spinach and cucumber.

- Slice the avocado and strawberries.

- Prepare the edamame by boiling or steaming it.

- Make the balsamic fig vinaigrette and store it in a separate container.

- Assemble the bowls by layering the ingredients and store them in airtight containers. Keep the dressing separate until ready to eat.

- Store the grain bowls in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.



Days 2-4 (Monday-Wednesday):



- Allocate around 5-10 minutes each day to grab a pre-made grain bowl from the fridge and add the balsamic fig vinaigrette on top.



Note: You can adjust the meal prep schedule based on your personal preferences and how many servings you want to make. You may also consider swapping out some of the ingredients for other vegetables or proteins that you prefer. Don't forget to properly store the grain bowls in the fridge and consume within 4 days to ensure food safety.
