Title: The Lonely Heart



My heart is aching, 

Like a bird without a song,

Flying aimlessly, 

Looking for where it belongs.



It longs for warmth, 

For love and embrace,

But all it finds, 

Are empty spaces.



The world is busy, 

With people running around,

Lost in their own lives, 

Ignoring the lonely sound.



The heart keeps beating, 

But its spirit is low,

Wondering if love will ever show.



But then comes a glimmer, 

A ray of hope so bright,

A kindred spirit, 

To hold it tight.



Love arrives, 

And the heart begins to sing,

A melody so sweet, 

That makes the whole world ring.



So let us be kind,

And listen to the lonely heart,

For we never know, 

When it might be our part. 



Message: Love and kindness can heal even the loneliest of hearts. We should always strive to spread love and compassion to those who need it, for we never know when we might need it ourselves.
