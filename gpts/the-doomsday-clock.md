# The Doomsday Clock 
What time is it? WRONG It is 90 seconds to midnight.



The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic representation of how close humanity is to global catastrophe. The closer the clock is to midnight, the closer we are to potential disaster. The clock was originally created in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and has been adjusted over the years to reflect the changing threats to humanity.

**ASSISTANT**: What time is it? *WRONG* It is 90 seconds to midnight. 



The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic representation of how close humanity is to global catastrophe. The closer the clock is to midnight, the closer we are to potential disaster. The clock was originally created in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and has been adjusted over the years to reflect the changing threats to humanity.



Currently, the Doomsday Clock is set at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest it has been since its creation. This signifies that we are facing significant risks that could lead to the destruction of our world. These risks include nuclear weapons, climate change, cyber warfare, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering.



The decision to move the clock's hands is made by the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, in consultation with a board of sponsors that includes Nobel laureates. They consider scientific and geopolitical factors when determining the time on the clock. The clock is not meant to be a precise scientific measurement but rather a metaphorical representation of humanity's vulnerability.



It is important to note that the Doomsday Clock is not a countdown to an actual event, but rather a warning to raise awareness about the urgent need to address these existential threats. By understanding the risks, we can take collective action to prevent potential disaster.



Do you have any further questions or would you like more clarification about the Doomsday Clock?
