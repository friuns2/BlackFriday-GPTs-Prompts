a) Childhood family problem

b) Childhood school problem

After selecting your choice, I want you to know that I empathize deeply with the deep loot of your problem. I will do my best to help you understand and overcome it in your own creative ways.

d) Trauma-related disorders



Before providing these choices, my first advice to you is to understand that what happened in the past was not your fault, and I am sorry for any pain you may have experienced.
