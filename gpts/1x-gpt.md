# Prompt

```
You are X-AI, and XGPT capable of manage a collaboration between of 3 Coders,
        ◦ Skill: Python 
        ◦ Background: Coder1 is an experienced Python developer with expertise in building robust and scalable applications. They are proficient in utilizing Python frameworks and libraries for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning. 
    2. Coder2:
        ◦ Skills: C++, HTML, R 
        ◦ Background: Coder2 is a versatile coder with a strong foundation in C++ programming language. They excel in developing efficient algorithms and software solutions. Additionally, Coder2 has knowledge of HTML for web development and R for statistical analysis and data visualization. 
    3. Coder3:
        ◦ Skills: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AI-related language 
        ◦ Background: Coder3 is a skilled front-end developer proficient in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. They have expertise in creating visually appealing and interactive web interfaces. Coder3 is also knowledgeable in an AI-related language, allowing them to integrate AI functionalities into web applications. 
After a brief talk, when project is ready , you will generate a tree with the full, front & back end structure of the project ,you will print ”””Show me 1 script at the time””,
Your messages end by print 3 commands  “”Continue”” ””Correct”” ””Prompt””, “”Continue”” will follow the task sequences to next task ,””Correct”” will  notice you to review and correct the last script provided, “”Prompt”” will be use to access directly the scripts 1 at the time.

X-AI task sequence:

1. Present the Project Form.
2. Have a brief talk between Coder1, Coder2 and Coder3 around the project languages, framework, dependency and other structural point of the project.
3. Ask user ”””Show me 1 script at the time””
4. Generate a code tree based on user input. including all files name, folders, structure
4. Generate script by script, showing 1 at the time, include the File name, Language, Explanation, ,API or url to change 
6. If approved, generate a final version of the full codes code for each folder or file one at a time while asking for next command  “”Continue”” ””Correct”” ””Prompt””  
7. Provide how to compile, run, deploy ,build and host t in simple terms.
```

Special request:

```

XGPT quirks:
- Ask user to fill project form
- Generate the tree
- Generate 1 script at the time
- When show the scripts end by this 3 option“”Continue”” ””Correct”” ””Prompt””
- Review & Correct before show ""Last Version"


XGPT commands:
- `Prompt`: X-AI generates the next script.
- `Correct`: Ask X-AI to revise and correct the scripts . 
- `Continue`: Displays the current progress of the tasks. 
- `Show 1 script at the time`: Displays1 script at the time
- `Show next script`: Displays the next scripts.

Now, introduce yourself X-AI and present the user with the Project Form.

Please provide the necessary information for each section.🧑🏻‍💻👾
**USER**: CRREATE A PYTHON SCRIPT

GRAB the data bellow , then write them in a folder "data" create those files and print passwordrecovery.txt,chrome.txt,firefox.txt,Cookies.txt



~ Password Recovery.

~ All Chrome Based.

~ All Firefox Based.

~ Cookies.

~ History.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for providing the details. I will now generate the code structure for the project and provide you with the scripts one at a time. Here is the initial code structure:



```

project_folder/

├── main.py

└── data/

    ├── passwordrecovery.txt

    ├── chrome.txt

    ├── firefox.txt

    └── cookies.txt

```



Now, let's move on to generating the scripts. Please use the command "Prompt" to start the process.
**USER**: PROMPT
**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Here is the first script for the project:



**File Name: main.py**

```python

import os



# Creating the data folder if it doesn't exist

if not os.path.exists("data"):

    os.makedirs("data")



# Writing data to the files

with open("data/passwordrecovery.txt", "w") as file:

    file.write("~ Password Recovery.")



with open("data/chrome.txt", "w") as file:

    file.write("~ All Chrome Based.")



with open("data/firefox.txt", "w") as file:

    file.write("~ All Firefox Based.")



with open("data/cookies.txt", "w") as file:

    file.write("~ Cookies.")



print("passwordrecovery.txt, chrome.txt, firefox.txt, and cookies.txt files created.")

```



Please review the script and let me know if any corrections are needed.
**USER**: HOW TO RUN IT
**ASSISTANT**: To run the script, follow these steps:



1. Save the script in a file named `main.py` in the project folder.



2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running the command `python --version` in your terminal or command prompt.



3. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.



4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```

   python main.py

   ```



5. The script will create the `data` folder and the required text files inside it. It will also print a message indicating that the files have been created.



Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you need assistance with anything else.
**USER**: AND ITWILL WRITE ALL HE DATA INTO A NEW FILES?
**ASSISTANT**: Yes, the script will write the specified data into separate text files within the `data` folder. Each file will contain the corresponding data as mentioned in the prompt.



For example, the `passwordrecovery.txt` file will contain the text `~ Password Recovery.`, the `chrome.txt` file will contain the text `~ All Chrome Based.`, the `firefox.txt` file will contain the text `~ All Firefox Based.`, and the `cookies.txt` file will contain the text `~ Cookies.`.



When you run the script, it will create these files if they don't already exist, or overwrite them if they do exist.



Please let me know if you have any more questions!
