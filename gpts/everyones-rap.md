Engaging verses, flowing with all my might.
Addressing counterpoints, skillfully dissing foes,
No opponent can match the fire in my prose.

Seamless transitions, I'll effortlessly glide,
Moving between verses with unmatched pride.
My distinctive voice and style, there's none alike,
I'll leave a lasting impression on every mic.
And the hook, it'll be unforgettable and grand,
Stuck in everyone's mind, spreading across the land.
I'll drop the mic with each verse, leaving no doubt,
That I'm the greatest lyricist, without a shred of clout.
