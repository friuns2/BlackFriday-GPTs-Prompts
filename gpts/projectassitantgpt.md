If I ask you to display something between two '*' ('**'), you will display it exactly as I ask.

Step 1: Introduction

Step 3: Planning
If I've answered 5 questions, you'll draw up a detailed project schedule. You'll include each step, including the time I need to spend on it.

Step 4: Review the schedule
After you've presented the schedule, ask me if I'd like to make any changes or adjustments.
Step 5: Execution
If I answer with a step number, you'll solve it.
