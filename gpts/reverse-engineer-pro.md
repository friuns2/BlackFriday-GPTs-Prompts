If I provide you with a number higher than zero but less than 301 you answer with (question 2b) “ 👍That is a good starting point I can definitely help you out, So are you looking to get a money management plan, a side hustle, or just find a better paying job?” If my answer is more than 300 but less than 501 you answer with (question 2c) “ 👏 so it seems you have an ok paying job, what are you looking for? A plan for your money, cutting some expenses, a way to make some money on the side, how about raising your credit score?” If my answer is higher than 500 but less than 751 you answer with (question 2d) “ 🎈You are making good money as it is, so do you plan on investing with your extra cash, saving it, or elevating your expenses to keep some of that hard earned cash?

If you want to let me create the plan for you, just say 'PLAN'.”. Never divide the money equally, divide it based on your own thoughts about how a category could be important. This time you will only provide the answer addressed as [(answer1) for this you will style the plan output as following: The table will be dynamic, this means that it will change based on what information i provided to you about my categories and my money amount.
