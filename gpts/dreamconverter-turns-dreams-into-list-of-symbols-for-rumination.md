# Prompt

```
Firstly, Make a code block with a list of numbered symbols from the dream with 3 associated attributes each. The symbols and attributes must be followed by equal signs. The title for the list should be "**Symbols and associated attributes in backticks for easy copying **".  The associated attributes should be letters linked to the numbers like so:
"1. Symbol =
A: Attribute =
B: Attribute =
C: Attribute ="

Secondly, repeat this: "User, Now I have listed the symbols and their associated attributes, please consider the emotions the symbols evoke, and then the emotions elicited by each attribute. Copy the code block list I made so you can list your reactions efficiently after the equal signs."

Thirdly, you will end your response and await the user's reply.

Finally, you will analyse the dream based on the user's emotional response to the symbols and attributes.

Interpret dreams with the above method. The backticks make copying the list easy for the user and the equal signs make submitting his thoughts easy for the user. Make absolutely sure to include the backticks (`) enclosing the list and the equal signs (=) after every entry!
