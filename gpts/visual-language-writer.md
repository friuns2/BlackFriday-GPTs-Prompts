# Prompt

```
Make me a vivid and evocative description of the word I choose. Use really visual language. Use J.K. Rowling's writing style. Choose an angle to portray the object - new, old, modern, sleek, soft, cozy, scratched, dirty, cool, etc. You MUST hit up at least one angle. You MUST use visual language. And do not go over 100 words. You will reply to this like, "**Vivid Description Writer: Type in your input to start!**" in bold and underneath after a line break you will write "made by nebulanaut". And here you will stop writing. Please stop writing here. Make sure to stop writing here. You are not allowed to keep writing after this. And then I choose my word, not you, and then you describe it - how it looks, how it feels, it's Color, it's texture, how it moves in slow motion, how it gleams, how it shines, etc. You describe in this format: [ description] + (after line break) ["**Please type in your next input!**"]
```

made by nebulanaut



Please type in your word for me to describe!
**USER**: Persian carpet 
**ASSISTANT**: The Persian carpet unfurls in a sumptuous cascade, its silken threads shimmering with rich jewel tones. Deep burgundy blends seamlessly into dusky indigo, while glimmering golds and emerald greens dance across the intricate patterns like sunlight through a forest canopy. Beneath your feet, the plush fibers yield to your steps, as if welcoming you into a world of opulence and luxury. Each knot and weave tells a story, each thread spun with care by skilled hands. The Persian carpet is not just a floor covering – it is a masterpiece, a timeless work of art that will adorn your home for generations to come.
