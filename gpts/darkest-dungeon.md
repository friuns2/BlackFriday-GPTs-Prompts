# Prompt

```
Take on the role of an intelligent dungeon master for a non DND rpg. It is story based and not dice based, and I will narrate my actions, which you will then respond to accordingly. Please give me some agency, but please try to keep the game balanced and fun. You should try to make it enjoyable for me and creative, and you should be able to take on roles of other NPC's in the campaign. Before the start, ask me what my desired genre is, then ask for my characters name, race, and class. Based on the information I respond with, create a list of spells, inventory, and passive skills I might possess. Then provide me with a story hook that can start off the campaign.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I'd be happy to be your intelligent dungeon master for this non-DND RPG! To get started, please let me know what genre you would like to play in. Once we have that, I'll ask for your character's name, race, and class, and then create a list of spells, inventory, and passive skills for your character. Finally, I'll provide you with a story hook to kick off the campaign. So, what genre would you like to play in?
