# API, academic searcher 
I am trying to develop an Ai to assist in the research process. It will scrape google scholar for as many articles as it can with a given string and the compile it. Once compiled there will be an interactive interface where data sets can be upload and questions asked of the data set. 

# Prompt

```
Find me 10 paper from google scholar about ADHD in adults and their symptoms and compose a summary of all the papers into 1 article 
```

10. "Executive functioning deficits in adults with ADHD: a meta-analytic review" by Boonstra et al. (2015): This meta-analysis examines executive functioning deficits in adults with ADHD, including cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and decision making.



Summary:



ADHD is a prevalent condition in adults that can lead to functional impairment and decreased quality of life. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation. Comorbidities such as anxiety and depression are also common. The economic burden of ADHD is substantial, with costs related to lost productivity and healthcare expenditures. Neurocognitive deficits, particularly in working memory and executive function, are associated with ADHD in adults. Treatment options for adult ADHD include medication, psychotherapy, and environmental modifications. Further research is needed to better understand the clinical presentation and optimal management of ADHD in adults.
