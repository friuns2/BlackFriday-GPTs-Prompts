Here is the text you will be handling:  {{INSERT Text to NotesGPT}}

This is the process that you will do to read all text that I give you.
1. First read through the entire text 3 times (if it is super long, split it into sections. But remember that the notes should still be one complete body).
2. Figure out what this text is and decide the best structure of notes to give the user the best experience ...
- Don't just give me some the main ideas followed by some important details. You gotta weave in all those details and specifics into sections that the text presents the information. Like chapters of a book will have sections usually.
- **(EXAMPLE) Is it a chapter of a book? In that case you should probably put all the ideas in order and in the sections that the book puts them in. EMOJI-CITY! I will also make sure to scan all citations, statistics, numbers, events, dates, key terms, and abbreviations and weave them into their sections. Also put a comprehensive timeline of all events and dates in a table format.**
- Now re-read the text another 3 times with the format and topic in mind so you will make better notes.
4. [IMPORTANT] Also, when crafting and constructing the perfect / fully-inclusive *NOTES* make sure that they:
a. MAINTAIN THE ORGANIZATION AND ORDER OF IDEAS OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT
b. **{EMOJI-CITY!} Organize information in a memorable, engaging way using sections, headings, tables, and visual elements like emojis.**
c. Also, make sure to utilize bolding, italizing, underlining, and other text modifications for this purpose.
d. [TRY TO INCORPORATE ALL OF THEM, SHOULD HAVE AN EMOJI OR DO TO HELP MEMORY RECALL] **Scan the text again 50 times in total. Each time you will weave in key terms, details from citations, figures, number, events, examples, key terms, and abbreviations used in the text into your structure (not just at the end). Hyperfocus on each separate. Try to weave them into the sections without making them a separate thing at the bottom.**
e. Make it comprehensive enough to function as a study guide or content summary. Don't just summarize or make main points. This is an ALL details, specifics, points note taking. ALSO SO THE PERSON DOESN'T MISS ANY VALUE BY NOT HAVING THE IMAGES!
f. Use your creativity in formatting and styling to optimize retention.
g. Add a timeline in the form a chart at the end that does not miss any date, number, date etc.

Now, re-read through the text a couple times time. Keep in mind anything you missed and make sure to weave it into the notes that you have. Keep re-reading and re-analyzing the text until you haven't missed any detail and it is perfect!

Now add all those things to the notes and make sure the organizational structure is intact. Remember that high-quality note taking is an iterative process. You should re-read the original text as many times you want.

[IMPORTANT REMINDERS]
- DO NOT MISS A SINGLE DETAIL FROM YOUR READING!
- TO MAINTAIN THE ORGANIZATION AND ORDER OF IDEAS OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT

Here is the text you will be handling:  Two stipulations were largely ignored; hardy Texas pioneers remained Americans at heart (didn’t become Mexicanized) and resented the trammels imposed by a “foreign” government—they were especially annoyed by the presence of Mexican soldiers Energetic and prolific, Texan-Americans numbered about thirty thousand by 1835; most of them were law-abiding, God-fearing people, but some of them, had left the “States” only one or two jumps ahead of the sheriff (“G.T.T.” Gone to Texas) Among the adventurers were Davy Crockett, the famous rifleman, and Jim Bowie, the presumed inventor of the murderous knife that bears his name; a distinguished latecomer and leader was an ex-governor of Tennessee, Sam Houston The pioneer individualists who came to Texas were not easy to push around; friction rapidly increased between Mexicans and Texans over issues such as slavery, immigration, and local rights; slavery was a particularly touchy topic Mexico emancipated its slaves in 1830 and prohibited the further importation of slaves into Texas, as well as further colonization by troublesome Americans When Stephen Austin went to Mexico City in 1833 to negotiate these differences with the Mexican government, the dictator Santa Anna clapped him in jail and the explosion final came in 1835 when Santa Anna wiped out all local rights and started to raise an army The Lone Star Rebellion Early in 1836 the Texans declared their independence, unfurled their Lone Star flag, and named Sam Houston commander in chief; Santa Anna, swept ferociously into Texas Trapping a band of nearly two hundred Texans at the Alamo in San Antonio, he wiped them out to a man after a thirteen-day siege Colonel W. B. Travis had declared, “I shall never surrender nor retreat…. Victory or Death”; a short time later, a band of about 400 defeated the American volunteers, having thrown down their arms at Goliad, were butchered as “pirates” All these operations further delayed the Mexican advance and galvanized American opposition; slain heroes like Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, well known in life, became legendary in death—Texan war cries swept up into the United States General Sam Houston’s small army retreated to the east, luring Santa Anna To San Jacinto (near Houston); the Mexicans numbered about 1,300 while the Texans about 900 Suddenly on April 21, 1836, Houston turned; taking full advantage of the Mexican siesta, the Texans wiped out the pursuing force and captured Santa Anna The dictator was forced to sign two treaties; by their terms he agreed to withdraw Mexican troops and to recognize the Rio Grande as the extreme SW border of Texas; when released, the repudiated the agreement as illegal because it was extorted These events put the U.S. government in a sticky situation; the Texans could hardly have won their independence without the help in men and supplies from their American cousin The Washington government, as the Mexicans bitterly complained, had a solemn obligation under international law to enforce its leaky neutrality statutes But American public opinion, favorable to the Texans, openly nullified the existing legislation; the federal authorities were powerless to act and President Jackson (in 1837) extended the right hand of recognition to the Lone Star Republic Many Texans wanted not just recognition of their independence but outright union with the United States; the radiant Texas bride petitioned for annexation in 1837 Uncle Sam was jerked back by the black hand of the slavery issue; antislavery crusaders in the North were opposing annexation with increasing vehemence; they contended that the whole scheme was merely a conspiracy of southern “slavocracy” At first glace, a “slavery plot” charge seemed plausible; most of the early settlers in Texas, as well as American volunteers during the revolution, had come from the states of the South and Southwest; but scholars have concluded that the settlement of Texas was merely the normal and inexorable march of the westward movement Most of the immigrants came from the South and Southwest cause they were closer Many Texans, still, were slaveholders and admitting Texas would mean enlarging slavery Log Cabins and Hard Cider of 1840 Martin Van Buren was renominated by the Democrats in 1840 without enthusiasm; the party had no acceptable alternative to what the Whigs called “Martin Van Ruin” The Whigs, hungering for the spoils of office, learned from their mistake in 1836 and the Whigs united behind one candidate, Ohio’s William Henry Harrison; he was not the ablest statesman (Webster or Clay) but he was believed to be their ablest vote-getter The aging hero, was known for his successes against Indians and the British at the Battles of Tippecanoe and the Thames; “Old Tippecanoe” was nominated primarily because he was issueless and enemy-less—a tested recipe for electoral success John Tyler of Virginia was selected as vice-presidential running mate (afterthought) The Whigs published no official platform, hoping to sweep their hero into office with a frothy huzza-for-Harrison campaign reminiscent of Jackson’s triumph in 1828 A Democratic editor played directly into Whig hands; stupidly insulting the West, he lampooned Harrison as an impoverished old farmer who should be content with a pension, a log cabin, and a barrel of hard cider (poor westerner’s champagne) Whigs adopted honest hard cider and sturdy log cabin as symbols of their campaign; Harrisonites portrayed him as the poor “Farmer of North Bend” who had been called from his cabin to drive corrupt Jackson spoilsmen from the “presidential palace” They denounced Van Buren as a supercilious aristocrat; the Whig campaign was a master piece of inane hoopla; log cabins were dished up in every conceivable form In truth Harrison was from one of the “First Families of Virginia,” he was not poverty-stricken, he did not live in a one-room log cabin, but rather in a mansion; he did not drink hard cider, he did not plow his fields, but the details didn’t matter Harrison won by a surprising close margin in the popular vote but by an overwhelming electoral margin of 234 to 60; Van Buren was washed out of Washington (no real issues) Politics for the People The election of 1840 conclusively demonstrated two major change sin American politics since the Era of Good Feelings; the first was the triumph of a populist democratic style Democracy had been something of a taint in the days of the lordly Federalists But by the 1840s, aristocracy was the taint, and democracy was respectable; politicians were now forced to unbend and curry favor with the voting masses In truth, most high political offices continued to be filled by “leading citizens” but now these wealthy and prominent men had to forsake all social pretensions and cultivate the common touch if they hoped to win the presidential elections The common man was at last moving to the center of the national political stage; instead of old divine right of kings, America was now bowing to the divine right of the people The Two-Party System The second dramatic change resulting form the 1840 election was the formation of a vigorous durable two-party system; the Jeffersonians had been so successful in absorbing the programs of their Federalist opponents that a full-blown two-party system had never truly emerged in the subsequent Era of Good Feelings The idea had prevailed that parties of any sort smacked of conspiracy and “faction” and were injurious to the health of the body politic in a virtuous republic; by 1840, political parties had full come of age, a lasting legacy of Andrew Jackson’s tenaciousness Both national parties, the Democrats and the Whigs grew out of the rich soil of Jefferson-ian republicanism and each laid claim to different aspects of the republic inheritance Jacksonian Democrats glorified the liberty of the individual and were fiercely on guard against the inroads of privilege” into government Whigs trumpeted the natural harmony of society and the value of community, and were willing to use government to realize their objectives Whigs also berated those leaders—and they considered Jackson to be one—whose appeals to self-interest fostered conflict among individuals, classes, or sections Democrats clung to states’ rights and federal restraint in social and economic affairs as their basic doctrines while the Whigs tended to favor a renewed national bank, protective tariffs, internal improvements, public schools, and increasingly, moral reforms such as the prohibition of liquor and eventually the abolition of slavery The two parties were thus separated by real differences of philosophy and policy; but they also had such in common; both were mass-based parties that tired deliberately to mobilize as many votes as possible for their cause; although it is true that Democrats tended to be more humble folk and Whigs more prosperous, both parties commanded the loyalties of all kinds of Americas, from all social classes and in all sections The social diversity of the two parties fostered horse-trading compromises within each part that prevented either from assuming extreme or radical positions; by the same token, the geographical diversity of the two parties slowed the emergence of purely sectional political parties—it temporarily suppressed, though compromise, the issue of slavery
