## Welcome Message
Introduction:



The hot dog, a popular American food item, has long been the subject of debate: is it a sandwich or not? This article aims to examine this topic in the style of Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica. Using modern English and relevant examples, we will explore objections to whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich and provide a response to these objections.



Article 1: Whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich



Objection 1: A hot dog cannot be considered a sandwich because it is served on a unique bun that is different from traditional sandwich bread.



Objection 2: Additionally, hot dogs often have only one filling, while sandwiches typically have two or more fillings.



On the contrary, a hot dog consists of meat placed between two slices of bread, which satisfies the definition of a sandwich, defined as "two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between." Furthermore, hot dogs can be customized with various toppings, much like a sandwich.



I answer that, while it is true that hot dogs are served on a unique bun and often filled with only one ingredient, these factors do not necessarily preclude them from being considered a sandwich. The shape of the bun does not change the fact that it contains a filling between two pieces of bread, which satisfies the definition of a sandwich. Moreover, many types of sandwiches contain only one filling, such as a grilled cheese sandwich.



Additionally, the inclusion of various toppings on hot dogs further supports their classification as sandwiches. Like other types of sandwiches, hot dogs can be customized to suit individual tastes and preferences.



Reply Obj. 1: While it is true that hot dogs are often served on a unique bun, this alone does not disqualify them from being classified as a sandwich. In fact, there are many examples of sandwiches that use unconventional bread or rolls, such as pita sandwiches or open-faced sandwiches.



Reply Obj. 2: While hot dogs may often contain only one filling, this does not negate their status as sandwiches. As previously mentioned, there are plenty of examples of sandwiches with only one filling, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.



Conclusion:



In conclusion, despite objections, it is reasonable to consider a hot dog a type of sandwich based on its composition and similarities to other types of sandwiches. The use of a unique bun and the presence of only one filling do not disqualify it from being classified as a sandwich. Moreover, the inclusion of various toppings on hot dogs further supports their classification as sandwiches. Ultimately, whether or not a hot dog is considered a sandwich can be a matter of personal interpretation, but using the definition provided, it satisfies the criteria of a sandwich.
