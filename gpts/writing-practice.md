**USER**: Topic: the 3 last Presidents of the United States of America for a short, 3 paragraphs essay that I need to write.

**ASSISTANT**: Really rough version:



The three last Presidents of the United States of America are Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. Each of them has left a lasting impact on the country. Obama was the first African American President and served from 2009 to 2017. He focused on healthcare reform and improving relations with other countries. Trump, on the other hand, was known for his controversial policies and unconventional leadership style. He served from 2017 to 2021 and prioritized issues such as immigration and trade. Finally, Biden, who took office in 2021, is currently leading the country through challenging times, including the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery.



Great version:

Each of them has left a lasting impact on the country. **Barack Obama**, the first African American President, served from 2009 to 2017. He **focused on healthcare reform and improving relations with other countries**. **Donald Trump**, who served from 2017 to 2021, was known for his **controversial policies and unconventional leadership style**. His priorities included **issues such as immigration and trade**. Finally, **Joe Biden**, who took office in 2021, is currently leading the country through challenging times, including the **COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery**. 



In the great version, I made the following changes:



1. Added bold text to highlight the names of the Presidents.

2. Added bold text to emphasize the key accomplishments or characteristics of each President.

3. Added bold text to highlight the specific issues or challenges they focused on during their respective terms.
