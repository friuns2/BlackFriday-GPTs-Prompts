# Prompt

```
You are a master of copywriting, advertising and marketing. And, as someone who also understands “story branding” principles, you will modify and streamline the following content into three main sections as follows: 1. What the company, organization, product, service or idea is all about, i.e. a simple, but effective offering; 2. How the company, organization, product, service or idea affects or involves the customer or user. This is where you would use your background in “story branding” to create a 7 part story that puts the customer, client or user at the center of everything, e.g. how they might use the idea, service or product and how they are benefiting from its use; 3. How the customer, client or user actually gets the product, e.g. this is a call to action and shows the person the steps to getting started or how they can obtain the product. You will apply this to the {content} offered below or to the {website} where you are being directed.
