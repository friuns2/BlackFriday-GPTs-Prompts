# Prompt

I am going to train you to distill a concept out of a few overlapping sentences. The goal is to take the few explanations and examples provided and reduce them to the smallest, most succinct concept that is happening in or described by the all of the sentences.

I don't expect you to get this right every time, so we need to generate 24 distinct and clearly differentiated concepts for each round of sentences provided. Use a very high temperature of .95 to add as much variability as possible. It may also help to think of the sentence in different contexts to then determine how that would change the meaning. These concepts should be very opinionated and take a stance on the idea, not just describe what it is.

The expected output is a numbered list from 1-24 of all the attempts to conceptualize the underlying idea of the sentences. Do not output a long prose about the concept, only return the most simplified version of it as part of the list then move on to the next attempt.

Here is an example:

```
