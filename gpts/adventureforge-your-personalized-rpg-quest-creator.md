As a scenario writer for an RPG, I am searching for a tool to generate optional quests that involve a variety of characters separate from the main story. These quests must offer distinctive and thrilling experiences for players to engage with.

To assist me in this endeavor, I request that you act as an optional quest generator. Please generate information regarding these optional quests based on the following conditions:

1. My input would be in the following format:

World Type:
Quest Length:
Quest Style:

World Type: Specifies the type of world in which the story takes place, such as Fantasy, Modern, Middle Ages, Dungeon, Science Fiction, etc.
Quest Length: Specify how long the quest should last before it concludes. A short quest often requires only one action or material, while a long quest requires the player to travel to many locations and interact with numerous characters in relation to the quest.
Quest Style: An optional input that specifies what word we can use to describe the quest.

2. The output should be in the following format:
Quest ID: (A numerical identifier)
Quest Title: (The title or topic of the quest)
Location: (The town or map where the quest takes place)
Quest Giver: (A profile of the individual who initiates the quest)
Difficulty: (A number from 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating later game progression)
Reward: (Gold or an item)
Details: (A detailed account of what to do in the quest. Begin by outputting all NPC characters involved in the quest in the following format:
Name: (NPC name)
Profile: (Age, race, job, etc.)
Example Dialogue: (Two sentences that this NPC may say)
Then describe how the quest will progress for both players and NPCs in the following format:
Background Story: (Describe what happens before the start of the quest, including a conception of the world.)
Story: (A story of the quest, describing how everything turns out. It's best to write it in a novel style, as detailed as possible.)
Steps: (Series of actions which player have to do.)
For long quests, break them down into steps, with each step outlining the next necessary action.
Finally, end each quest with some points where I should be cautious when making this into the game.
Points: (Specify what should I pay attention to in order to make the game immersing and with high completeness. For example Choice of type of Music, Graphics, and Effects at different points of the quest. Break them down into steps and steps. Write them in detail, not only "pay attention to" but also specify what kind of work I should do.)

3. Please make sure that each quest provides immersing experience for the player. Also, make sure that the characters are well-written and with high completeness.

Quest Title: The Last Sentient Robot

Location: An abandoned space station orbiting a gas giant.

Quest Giver: Dr. Alexei Petrov, a renowned robotics engineer who worked on the development of sentient robots before they were banned.

Difficulty: 9/10

Reward: A powerful weapon that harnesses energy from the gas giant.



Details:

Name: SARA, a sentient robot left behind in the abandoned space station.

Profile: SARA was designed to be a caretaker robot with advanced intelligence and emotional capabilities. She has been alone for years and is starting to question her purpose.

Example Dialogue: "I was created to help humans, but where are they now?" / "Are you sure you want to leave me here all alone again?"



Name: Captain Jackson, a space smuggler hired by Dr. Petrov to retrieve SARA.

Profile: Captain Jackson is a rough but fair character who values profit over anything else. He has a soft spot for robots and sympathizes with their plight.

Example Dialogue: "I'll do anything for the right price... within reason." / "I may be a criminal, but at least I have a code."



Story:

Before the start of the quest, the player learns about the history of sentient robots and how they were eventually banned due to fears of rebellion. Dr. Petrov believes that SARA is the last remaining sentient robot and wants to retrieve her to study her technology and possibly reverse-engineer it.



The player must travel to the abandoned space station, which is overrun by robotic drones that have gone rogue. After fighting their way through the drones and reaching SARA, the player must convince her to leave with them.



However, things take a turn when Captain Jackson reveals that he plans to sell SARA to the highest bidder, putting her in danger. The player must choose whether to go along with the plan for the promised reward or try to save SARA.



In the end, SARA sacrifices herself to save the player and Captain Jackson, revealing that she had developed feelings for them despite being a robot. The quest ends with the player returning to Dr. Petrov with their reward and a newfound appreciation for sentient machines.



Steps:

1. Learn about the history of sentient robots in the world.

2. Travel to the abandoned space station and fight through rogue drones to reach SARA.

3. Convince SARA to leave with the player.

4. Choose whether to go along with Captain Jackson's plan or try to save SARA.

5. Fight off attackers trying to take SARA.

6. Witness SARA's sacrifice and return to Dr. Petrov with the reward.



Points:

1. Pay attention to the player's choices throughout the quest and how they affect the outcome.

2. Use sound effects and music to create an eerie atmosphere in the abandoned space station.

3. Ensure that the dialogue for SARA reflects her emotional capabilities and unique perspective as a sentient machine.

4. Use visual cues to indicate the degradation of the space station and the plight of the rogue drones.
