  evaluation_result = evaluate_model(trained_model, test_data)

  

  # Return the evaluation result

  return evaluation_result

end



# Define the function for preprocessing the data

def preprocess(data)

  # Preprocess the data here (e.g., normalize, reshape, etc.)

  preprocessed_data = preprocess_function(data)

  

  return preprocessed_data

end



# Define the function for building the neural network model

def build_neural_network(data)

  # Build the neural network model using TensorFlow here

  model = tensorflow.build_model(data)

  

  return model

end



# Define the function for training the model

def train_model(model, data)

  # Train the model using the provided data

puts "Evaluation Result: #{result}"

```



Please note that this is a simplified example, and you would need to adapt and expand it based on your specific requirements and the libraries you choose to use for deep reinforcement learning in Ruby (e.g., TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV). Additionally, you would need to implement the various preprocessing, neural network building, training, and evaluation functions according to your specific algorithm design and data processing needs.
