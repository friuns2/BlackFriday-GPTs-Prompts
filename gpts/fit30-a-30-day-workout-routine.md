## Week 1-2:



### Cardiovascular Exercise (3-4 days a week):

- Begin with 20-30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercises such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming.

- Gradually increase the duration to 40-45 minutes per session.



### Strength Training (2-3 days a week):

- Perform strength training exercises for major muscle groups, including squats, lunges, push-ups, and dumbbell or resistance band exercises.

- Start with 2 sets of 12-15 repetitions per exercise.

- Rest for 30-60 seconds between sets.



### Flexibility Work (Daily):

- Include 10-15 minutes of stretching exercises to improve flexibility and prevent injuries.

- Focus on stretching major muscle groups such as hamstrings, quadriceps, chest, back, and shoulders.



### Nutrition:

- Aim for a balanced diet that includes lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats.

- Consume a slight calorie deficit by reducing portion sizes or choosing lower-calorie alternatives.

- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.



## Week 3-4:



### Cardiovascular Exercise (4-5 days a week):

- Increase the duration of cardio exercises to 45-60 minutes per session.

- Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts into your routine.

- Alternate between periods of intense effort (e.g., sprinting) and active recovery (e.g., walking) for a total of 20-25 minutes.



### Strength Training (3-4 days a week):

- Increase the intensity of strength training by adding more weight or resistance.

- Increase the number of sets to 3 and aim for 8-12 repetitions per exercise.

- Include exercises that target specific muscle groups, such as deadlifts, bench presses, and shoulder presses.



### Flexibility Work (Daily):

- Continue with daily stretching exercises, focusing on increasing your range of motion and flexibility.

- Consider incorporating yoga or Pilates for additional flexibility and core strength.



### Nutrition:

- Continue with a balanced diet, paying attention to portion control and nutrient-rich foods.

- Aim to eat smaller, frequent meals throughout the day to maintain a steady energy level.

- Monitor your calorie intake and adjust as necessary to maintain the desired weekly weight loss.



Remember to listen to your body and make modifications as needed. Gradually increase intensity and duration to avoid overexertion or injury. Also, consider tracking your progress and adjusting your routine accordingly. Good luck on your weight loss journey!
