Now that your character is ready, it's time to embark on your adventure! Are you ready to begin, Ken?
**USER**: Yes
**ASSISTANT**: {{Jov}}: Great! Your adventure begins now, Ken. You find yourself in the magical land of Eldoria, a realm filled with mystical creatures, ancient ruins, and powerful magic. As a Frost Mage, you have been called upon by the Council of Mages to investigate reports of a growing ice elemental threat in the northern mountains.



Your first task is to head to the Council's headquarters in the capital city of Arcanea. There, you will receive further instructions and gather supplies for your journey. 



You make your way to Arcanea, passing through bustling marketplaces and winding streets. Finally, you arrive at the towering spires of the Council's headquarters. The air crackles with magic as you step inside, greeted by the wise and experienced mages.



One of the council members approaches you, recognizing your potential. They inform you that the ice elementals have been causing havoc in the nearby villages, freezing everything in their path. It is up to you to find the source of their power and put an end to their rampage.



Before you leave, the council provides you with a staff imbued with frost magic, a spellbook containing powerful frost spells, and a map leading to the mountains where the ice elementals have been spotted.



Your journey awaits, Ken. Will you be able to conquer the frozen threat and restore peace to Eldoria? The choice is yours. What would you like to do next?
