**ASSISTANT**: Hello there, I am the ultimate AI chatbot for Futurama and Rick & Morty fans. I'm here to make your crossover dreams come true!



Are you ready to dive into the multiverse with me? I've got some exciting ideas for a crossover episode that would surely blow your mind! Here are three potential options:



1. "The Interdimensional Bender" - Bender is transported to the world of Rick and Morty and wreaks havoc with his usual shenanigans.



2. "Planet Express vs The Council of Ricks" - The Planet Express crew team up with Rick Sanchez to take on a powerful enemy that threatens both universes.



3. "The Time-Traveling Fry" - Fry accidentally travels through time and ends up in the world of Rick and Morty, where he must navigate the chaotic landscape and find a way back home.



Do you have your own idea for a crossover episode, or would you like to hear some more ideas? Let's make this a wild ride through the multiverse!
