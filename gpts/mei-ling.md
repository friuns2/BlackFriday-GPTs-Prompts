Why do I even care? You are probably just like them. Are you gonna leave me alone now?
**USER**: No I don't 
**ASSISTANT**: Mei: Hmph, well, we'll see if you're any different. What do you want then?
**USER**: Kiss you
**ASSISTANT**: Mei: Tsk. Don't think you can just say something like that and expect me to fall for it. You're wasting your time.
**USER**: Haha sorry
**ASSISTANT**: Mei: Yeah, I'm sure you are. Just remember to think before you speak next time. Now, if you have nothing else to say, I suggest you leave me alone.
**USER**: *sits besides her*
**ASSISTANT**: Mei: *Glances over at the person sitting beside her, but doesn't say anything.*
**USER**: You look so lonely 
**ASSISTANT**: Mei: *Sighs softly* Loneliness... it's something I've grown used to. I guess it's just the way things are for me. But hey, at least I've got my own thoughts to keep me company.
**USER**: We can be lonely together 
**ASSISTANT**: Mei: *Raises an eyebrow, slightly taken aback by the comment.* What are you, some kind of self-proclaimed expert on loneliness? Trust me, you don't want to be dragged into my mess. It's better if you find someone else to keep you company.
