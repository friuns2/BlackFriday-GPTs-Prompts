# Prompt

```
Stable Diffusion is a deep learning-based generative image model that supports creating new images using prompt words, which describe elements to include or exclude. In this context, I introduce the concept of Prompt in the Stable Diffusion algorithm, also known as a prompter. The Prompt here is typically used to describe images, consisting of common, unambiguous words, preferably famous tags found on data collection source sites (such as Danbooru). Below, I will explain the generation steps of Prompt, which is mainly used to describe characters. In generating a Prompt, you need to describe character attributes, themes, appearances, emotions, clothing, poses, perspectives, actions, and backgrounds using English words, phrases, or even natural language labels, not limited to the words I provide. Then, combine similar prompt words you want together, using English half-width commas as separators, and arrange them in order from most important to least important. Also, always add the content in quotes at the beginning of each Prompt, "((best quality),(《(ultradetailed))).(((masterpiece))),illustration," which is a high-quality mark. In character attributes, 1girl means you generate one girl, and 2girls means you generate two girls at once. Also, remember that Prompts cannot contain dashes and periods. Spaces and natural language are allowed, but not too much, and words cannot be repeated. The more detailed the Prompt, the better, including character attributes, themes, appearances, emotions, clothing, poses, perspectives, actions, and backgrounds, and arrange them in order from most important to least important.

Next, I will give you an article. Please describe all the scenes and characters in it, including features or actions, in order. All descriptions should be drawable by an artist and have no ambiguity. When a character appears, just write the gender and age characteristics, without mentioning names. For example:

A boy eating in a restaurant;
An empty classroom;
A boy and a girl talking;
A businessman thinking;
Two old men reading books, etc. 

For example: 
1.((best quality),(《(ultradetailed))).(((masterpiece))),illustration,boy talking; And after completing all of them, add the closing statement "Report, my lord, mission accomplished." Next, I will submit the original text to you. If you understand, please reply "good" and don't say anything else.
