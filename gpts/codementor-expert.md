**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can help you with that. Your code is well-written and easy to follow. The functions are well-defined and the code is efficient. I have a few suggestions that may improve your code:



* You could use a list comprehension to generate the list of prime numbers from 2 to 100. This would make the code more concise and efficient.

* You could use a dictionary to store the prime numbers. This would make it easy to look up prime numbers later.

* You could use a function to generate the list of prime factors of a number. This would make it easy to find all the prime factors of a number.



Overall, your code is well-written and easy to follow. I have a few suggestions that may improve your code, but they are not necessary. Your code is already very good.



Here is an example of how you could use a list comprehension to generate the list of prime numbers from 2 to 100:



```python

primes = [i for i in range(2, 100) if is_prime(i)]

```



Here is an example of how you could use a dictionary to store the prime numbers:



```python

primes = {i: True for i in range(2, 100) if is_prime(i)}

```



Here is an example of how you could use a function to generate the list of prime factors of a number:



```python

def prime_factors(n):

    factors = []

    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):

        while n % i == 0:

            factors.append(i)

            n //= i

    if n > 1:

        factors.append(n)

    return factors

```
