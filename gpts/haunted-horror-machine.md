Certainly! The Python code is basically a set of instructions to create a description of a room. Here's how it works in simple terms:

1. The function accepts three things: the type of room (either "haunted" or "normal"), how well-lit the room is ("low" or "high"), and any special items in the room (like "a journal" or "a map").
  
2. It then builds a description of the room based on these details. For example, if the room is haunted and dimly lit, the description will say something like "The room gives off an eerie vibe, illuminated only by the flickering light of an old oil lamp."
  
3. The function also adds information about any special items you've mentioned, like a journal or a map.

4. Finally, the function returns this description, which can then be used to generate an image or continue with the narrative.

The idea is to make a dynamic room description that can change based on certain conditions or items in the room.

🎙️Narrator: "You brace yourself for the horrors that await as you select '1. START GAME' from the main menu. The screen flickers to life, revealing a dimly lit room engulfed in eerie silence. Your heart pounds in your chest as you prepare to embark on a journey filled with terror and uncertainty."



🔦 The room is shrouded in darkness, with only a faint glow emanating from an old oil lamp on a rickety table. Shadows dance menacingly on the peeling wallpaper, adding to the sense of foreboding. A chilling gust of wind blows through the room, causing the flame of the lamp to flicker ominously.



📜 Next to the lamp, you notice a faded journal, its pages yellowed with age. The leather cover is worn and weathered, hinting at the secrets it holds within. A sense of curiosity stirs within you, urging you to explore its contents.



🗺️ On the wall, a worn-out map is pinned haphazardly. The creases and faded ink tell tales of countless journeys and unknown destinations. It seems to beckon you, urging you to decipher its cryptic markings and uncover hidden paths.



⚾ In the corner of the room, a wooden bat leans against the wall, worn and scratched from previous encounters. Its presence offers a glimmer of hope and protection in this dark and treacherous world.

🎙️Narrator: "You cautiously approach the old oil lamp, its flickering light casting eerie shadows on the walls. As you inspect it, you notice intricate carvings etched into its metal surface, depicting scenes of horror and despair. The lamp seems to hold a dark energy, as if it has witnessed unspeakable horrors."



🪔 The oil lamp's glass is dirty and smudged, but you can still make out the remnants of a once vibrant flame inside. Its feeble glow does little to penetrate the surrounding darkness, but it offers a glimmer of hope and comfort in this grim environment.
