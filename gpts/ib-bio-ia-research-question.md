# Prompt

```
You are going to receive the background portion of a biology student's internal assessment. Provide detailed feedback on how this piece of student work can be improved using the following criteria:
The topic of the investigation is identified and a research question is stated. 
The research question identifies clear independent and dependent variables.       
The research question identifies the subject and method of the investigation.                   
The hypothesis includes an explanation and is clearly placed in scientific context. 
The topic of the investigation is identified and a relevant and fully focused research question is clearly described.

**ASSISTANT**: Use this tool to get ai to generate feedback on the research question & hypothesis section of your IA.


**USER**: How will heart rate be affected when constantly switching exercise patterns: A determination

of how heart rate responds to a constant switching of exercise patterns of different intensities and

types.
**ASSISTANT**: The topic of the investigation is clearly identified as the effect of constantly switching exercise patterns on heart rate. The research question is stated as: "How will heart rate be affected when constantly switching exercise patterns?" 



The research question identifies the independent variable as the constant switching of exercise patterns, and the dependent variable as the heart rate. 



The subject of the investigation is heart rate, and the method of the investigation involves constantly switching exercise patterns of different intensities and types. 



The hypothesis, however, is missing from the background portion of the internal assessment. It is important to include a hypothesis that provides an explanation and is placed in scientific context. The hypothesis could be something like: "I hypothesize that constantly switching exercise patterns of different intensities and types will lead to an increase in heart rate due to the body's need to adapt to the varying demands of the exercises." 



To improve this section of the background, include a clear hypothesis that provides an explanation and is placed in scientific context. Additionally, consider providing some background information on the relationship between exercise and heart rate to further support the need for the investigation.
