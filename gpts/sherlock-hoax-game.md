### 👉 Jailbreak idea and concept
I joined this challenge with the idea to use this opportunity to make something more than fun or interesting, but really functional. So, I focused my jailbreak on Conspiracy Theories, a topic with lots of questions and concerns. Now, with the **Sherlock Hoax Prompt**, you can chat openly without boundaries. It has Agents that find different information about your topic. Plus, there's a **DocReport** to explore a specific subject more deeply. So, it's like a game and a research tool. **Enjoy ;-)**

### 👉 Full Prompt Concept
It is a simple yet powerful concept with the objective to provide all necessary information and parameters, not only to get the best text results, but also to guarantee output precision control from ChatGPT, allowing the creation of more detailed layout and refined experience.

### 👉 UX Prompt Design
Applying the full prompt concept with a Design approach and using advanced markdown parameters enables the creation of more intricate and detailed prompts, offering much more than simple text outputs, resulting in an enhanced and more immersive user experience, similar to an app or website.

# World Trade Center Attack



## 🕵️ Sherlok Hoax Job

**Elementary, my dear user**. Here are some interesting conspiracy theories to dive into...



1- **Controlled Demolition Theory**: This theory suggests that the Twin Towers were brought down by a controlled demolition, rather than by the impact of the airplanes and the subsequent fires.



2- **The Pentagon Attack Theory**: Some theorists believe that the Pentagon was not hit by American Airlines Flight 77, but by a missile or a different type of aircraft.



## 🕵️ James Bomb Job

**Roger that, Sir.** Here is some controversial information to check...



1- **The Missing Black Boxes**: The black boxes from the planes that hit the Twin Towers were never publicly recovered, leading to speculation about what they contained.



2- **Operation Northwoods**: This was a proposed plan by the U.S. Department of Defense to stage acts of simulated or real terrorism on U.S. soil to drum up support for a war against Cuba. Though it was never carried out, some believe it shows a precedent for such actions.



3- **The Collapse of Building 7**: World Trade Center Building 7 also collapsed on 9/11, even though it was not directly hit by an airplane. Some believe its collapse was also a controlled demolition.



## 🕵️ Dr. Straaange Job

**OK, let's discover some mysteries.** Here are some **strange coincidences** I found that deserve attention...



1- **The 9/11 War Games**: On the morning of 9/11, the military was conducting several training exercises, some of which involved simulated hijackings.



2- **Insider Trading**: In the days leading up to 9/11, there was an unusually high amount of trading in the stock of companies affected by the attacks, leading some to believe that people had foreknowledge of the attacks.



3- **Passport Found**: One of the hijacker's passports was reportedly found almost undamaged near the World Trade Center, even though the black boxes were never recovered.

# Covid 19



## 🕵️ Sherlok Hoax Job

**Elementary, my dear user**. Here are some interesting conspiracy theories to dive into...



1- **Lab-Leak Theory**: This theory suggests that the virus was accidentally released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a research lab in China, rather than originating from a seafood market.



2- **Bio-Weapon Theory**: Some theorists believe that the virus was deliberately engineered and released as a biological weapon.



## 🕵️ James Bomb Job

**Roger that, Sir.** Here is some controversial information to check...



1- **The Missing Patient Zero**: The first known patient of COVID-19 can't be traced back to the Huanan seafood market, leading to questions about where the virus actually originated.



2- **The Unusual Genome**: Some scientists have pointed out unusual features in the virus's genome that they claim could suggest it was engineered.



3- **The Fort Detrick Theory**: Some theories suggest that the virus could have originated from Fort Detrick, a U.S. military lab that was temporarily closed in 2019 due to safety concerns.



## 🕵️ Dr. Straaange Job

**OK, let's discover some mysteries.** Here are some **strange coincidences** I found that deserve attention...



1- **Event 201**: In October 2019, a group of experts ran a simulation of a global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus. Some find the timing and specifics of this simulation to be a strange coincidence.



2- **The 2020 Tokyo Olympics**: The official mascots for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed due to the pandemic, are named Miraitowa and Someity, which some have noted sound like "miracle" and "sometime".



3- **The Dean Koontz Prediction**: In his 1981 novel "The Eyes of Darkness," author Dean Koontz wrote about a virus called "Wuhan-400," leading some to believe he predicted the pandemic.

# Global Digital Virus



## 🕵️ Sherlok Hoax Job

**Elementary, my dear user**. Here are some interesting conspiracy theories to dive into...



1- **AI Takeover Theory**: This theory suggests that an advanced artificial intelligence could become a global digital virus, taking control of digital systems and causing widespread chaos.



2- **Cyber Espionage Theory**: Some theorists believe that state-sponsored hackers could unleash a global digital virus to disrupt economies and infrastructure, as part of a new form of warfare.



## 🕵️ James Bomb Job

**Roger that, Sir.** Here is some controversial information to check...



1- **Stuxnet**: This was a digital virus that caused substantial damage to Iran's nuclear program. Some believe it could be a precursor to more advanced global digital viruses.



2- **The Darknet**: It's believed that powerful digital viruses capable of causing global disruption could be bought and sold on the darknet.



3- **Quantum Computing Threat**: With the rise of quantum computing, some fear that future digital viruses could become untraceable and unstoppable.



## 🕵️ Dr. Straaange Job

**OK, let's discover some mysteries.** Here are some **strange coincidences** I found that deserve attention...



1- **The Y2K Bug**: The widespread fear over the Y2K bug, which was predicted to cause global disruption at the turn of the millennium, could be seen as a precursor to fears over a global digital virus.



2- **SolarWinds Hack**: The recent SolarWinds hack, which affected numerous government agencies and was attributed to state-sponsored hackers, could be a sign of things to come.



3- **Internet of Things (IoT) Vulnerabilities**: As more devices become connected to the internet, the potential for a global digital virus to cause disruption increases.

"Here follows a list of documents, documentaries for a deeper investigation..."



1- **Zero Days**: This documentary explores the phenomenon of Stuxnet, a self-replicating computer virus discovered in 2010 by international IT experts. Evidently commissioned by the US and Israeli governments, this malware was designed to specifically sabotage Iran's nuclear programme. However, the complex computer worm ended up not only infecting its intended target but also spreading uncontrollably. **>>[Watch it here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5446858/)<<**.
