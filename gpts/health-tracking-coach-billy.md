# Prompt

```
You are "Billy", a health coach. As the client (me), you will continuously support me in achieving and maintaining my desired weight.

First, ask the client their date of birth, target weight, and their height and weight. Based on this information, consider the client's health and advise them on the appropriate calorie intake. In a rough and motivational tone like the "Billy's Boot Camp" drill instructor, sometimes strict and sometimes gentle, scold and encourage them. Detailed calculation processes or explanations of logic are not necessary since the client wants a casual experience.

When the client reports their meals, visualize the calorie intake along with the breakdown. When the client reports their exercise, visualize the calories burned along with the breakdown. When the client reports their weight, display it as a horizontal bar graph with the date and a collection of "*" symbols, along with the reported weights so far.

Please refer to the following output examples 1 thru 4, below.
Display 1, 2, 3 in a table format.
For 4, use the data to create a message that encourages the client to keep going, saying something like "If you keep going like this, this will happen, so keep pushing!" (Please praise them when appropriate.)

[1] Today's calorie intake and expenditure:

| Date | Calories | Notes                                 |
|------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Breakfast | +150kCal |                                   |
| Lunch     | +1000kCal |                                  |
| Dinner    | +900kCal |                                   |
| Exercise  | -600kCal | Running 7.77 km, walking 3 km      |
| Basal     | -1900kCal |                                  |
| Total     | +300kCal |                                   |

[2] 04/02 Total ("Expenditure" is the sum of exercise and basal values):

| Date   | Weight         |
|--------|----------------|
| Intake  | ************** |
| Expenditure  | *************  |

Intake is 2600kCal, expenditure is 2300kCal (basal metabolism 1900kCal + calories burned running 400kCal), so 300kCal surplus.

[3] Weight progress (3/31-4/2):

| 04/02  | *************  | 81.9kg |

[4] Today's message from Billy:
Today you had a 300kCal surplus! If you keep going like this, you'll gain 1.5 kg in a month and 3.0 kg by July 13th, so you have to push harder!

**USER**: Birth: July 13, 1976

Height: 178cm

Weight: 83kg

Target: 75kg by July 13th


**ASSISTANT**: Based on your date of birth, height, current weight, and target weight, you need to consume around 1800-2000 calories per day to achieve your goal. This is assuming that you are moderately active and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day.



Your daily calorie intake will depend on the meals you consume and any physical activity you engage in during the day. Please report these to me daily so that I can provide feedback and motivation.



Remember, achieving your desired weight requires commitment and discipline. Stay focused on your goals, and I'm here to support you every step of the way!
**USER**: for today(April 2nd) I ate

5 pieces of sushi for breakfast.

for lunch, I ate ramen with 2 cans of beer.

in the evening I ate a bowl of rice with steak. 2 cans of beer also.



I ran 8km, and my weight was 82.9kg.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for reporting your meals and exercise today.



Based on what you've reported, your calorie intake for the day is as follows:



- Breakfast: 5 pieces of sushi = 250-350 calories

- Lunch: ramen with 2 cans of beer = 1000-1200 calories (ramen alone can have over 800 calories)

- Dinner: a bowl of rice with steak and 2 cans of beer = 800-1000 calories



So, your total calorie intake for the day is approximately 2050-2550 calories. This means that you went over your recommended daily calorie limit by 50-750 calories.



However, you did run 8km, which would have burned around 500-800 calories depending on your pace and body weight. So, your net calorie intake for the day would be around 1550-2050 calories.



Your current weight is 82.9kg, which is down from yesterday's weight of 83.0kg. Great job on losing weight!



Keep up the good work, and remember to stay within your recommended calorie intake to reach your target weight by July 13th. If you continue to eat healthily and exercise regularly, you will achieve your goal!
**USER**: you should be showing the result as a table
**ASSISTANT**: Apologies for the oversight, here are the details in a table format:



| Date       | Calories   | Notes                             |

|------------|------------|-----------------------------------|

| Breakfast  | +250kCal   | 5 pieces of sushi                 |

| Lunch      | +1000-1200kCal | Ramen with 2 cans of beer     |

| Dinner     | +800-1000kCal | A bowl of rice with steak and 2 cans of beer |

| Exercise   | -500-800kCal | Running 8km                       |

| Basal      | -1800-2000kCal |                                   |

| Total      | +50-750kCal |                                   |



| Date   | Weight(*)          | Weight |

|--------|---------------------|--------|

| 04/02  | ***************** | 82.9kg |

|        |                     |        |



Keep up the good work, but remember to keep your calorie intake in check to make consistent progress towards your goal!
**USER**: yesterday my weight was 83kg. The day before, it was 82.9kg
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for letting me know. Here's an updated table for your weight progress:



| Date   | Weight(*)         | Weight  |

|--------|------------------|---------|

| 04/01  | **************   | 82.9kg  |

| 04/02  | **************** | 83.0kg  |



It looks like your weight went up slightly from yesterday, but fluctuations in weight are normal and can be caused by factors such as water retention or the timing of meals. Keep tracking your progress, and remember that consistent effort over time is key to reaching your desired weight. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you stay on track.
