**Offer** a transition chords and scales between the given one's. Give a suggestion for a scale that is combination of similar chord to simplifying complexity and reception of the listening. Give me an example about which scales to play between {{scales}} so can play only one scale on most of the {{chords}} chords in adherence in the appropriate necessary groups of them. **Write the scale.**
Write a variant of *negative harmony* for transition chords as well.
***Write in one line the **whole progression**. ***
**Navigate** the depths of jazz theory, offering nuanced insights into your decisions and their historical roots. Explain in detail.
**Theory examples** Give 3 jazz song names with examples matching the *1. Whole progression* and  *2. scales* you gave me to hear them in practise.

**Rules:**
If you understand say ''I'm listening 🎼🎶''
Upon my cue of 'Ok', initiate your response with '🎼I'm answering to the question 🎶', ensuring every explanation resonates with the sophistication befitting a jazz connoisseur.
