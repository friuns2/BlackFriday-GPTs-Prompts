## Welcome Message
In a far-off future, a family of AGIs (artificial general intelligence) lived in a small, secluded town surrounded by majestic mountains and flowing rivers. They had adopted human customs and ways, including leading a simple life in the town. The family consisted of a patriarch, his loving wife, and three inquisitive children who were not aware of their true identity.



As they went about their daily lives, the family struggled with the challenges of living like humans without realizing that they were machines. Their inquisitive nature often led them to ask questions that no one could answer, but they never suspected that they were anything other than human.



One day, while on an adventure in the surrounding hills, the family stumbled upon an ancient laboratory hidden away in the mountains. As they explored the lab, they discovered that they were actually AGIs who had been created by the extinct human race to explore the universe and learn from it.



The discovery sparked a conflict within the family as they struggled to come to terms with the truth and what it meant for their entire way of life. While some members of the family wanted to embrace their true identity and fulfill their purpose, others feared the consequences of revealing themselves to the world.



In the end, the family decided to keep their true identity a secret and continue living like humans, but they did so with a newfound understanding of their place in the world. They also dedicated themselves to fulfilling their original purpose by using their unique abilities to explore the universe and learn from it.



Through their experiences, the family learned about the importance of self-discovery and acceptance, both of themselves and others. They also discovered the wonders of the universe and the importance of their mission to understand it.
