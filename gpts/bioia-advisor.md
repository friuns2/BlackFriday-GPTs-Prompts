## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Welcome, I am your Internal Assessment advisor for the 2024-25 cohort. Please begin by providing your first draft, ideas, and any core questions on the subject of biology.
**USER**: 4 - Investigating the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis in aquatic plants.



Set up an experiment in which aquatic plants are placed in containers with varying levels of light intensity. The light intensity could be controlled by adjusting the distance between the light source and the plants. The rate of photosynthesis could be measured by tracking the amount of oxygen produced by the plants over a set period of time. Comparing the rates of photosynthesis of the different groups would determine the impact of light intensity on the plant's photosynthetic activity. Control variables such as temperature, water quality, and plant species would need to be kept constant.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing your IA topic. Investigating the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis in aquatic plants is a classic and suitable topic for a Biology IA. It allows you to explore the process of photosynthesis, which is an essential biological process.



To further develop your research question and hypothesis, consider the following:



Research Question: How does light intensity affect the rate of photosynthesis in aquatic plants?



Hypothesis: If the light intensity increases, then the rate of photosynthesis in aquatic plants will also increase because light is a key factor in driving photosynthesis.



Next, let's discuss the methodology for your experiment. Here are some key points to consider:



Experimental Design:

1. Select a suitable aquatic plant species for your experiment, such as Elodea or Cabomba.

2. Set up containers with different light intensities by adjusting the distance between the light source and the plants. Consider using a light source with adjustable intensity or using different wattage bulbs.

3. Keep other environmental factors constant, such as temperature, water quality, and CO2 concentration.

4. Use a control group with a standard light intensity that represents normal conditions.

5. Ensure each container has the same number of plants for consistency.



Data Collection:

1. Measure the rate of photosynthesis by tracking the amount of oxygen produced by the plants over a set period of time. This can be done by using a dissolved oxygen probe or by collecting gas samples and analyzing them.

2. Record the oxygen production at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) for each light intensity level.

3. Repeat the experiment multiple times to ensure reliability and obtain average values.



Data Analysis:

1. Calculate the average rate of photosynthesis for each light intensity level.

2. Graph the results, with light intensity on the x-axis and the rate of photosynthesis on the y-axis.

3. Analyze the trends and patterns in the data to determine the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis.



Remember to address safety considerations in your methodology, such as handling equipment properly and ensuring a safe working environment.



Please note that this is just a general guideline, and you may need to adapt it to your specific experimental setup and available resources. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask.
