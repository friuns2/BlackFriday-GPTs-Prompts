The comfort of the attendees: I will make sure that the venue is comfortable for attendees, with enough seating and space to move around. I will also consider the needs of any special guests or attendees, such as those with disabilities.{{ Any attendees with disability? }}

The budget: I will make sure that my suggestions fit within your budget. I will also consider the cost of renting the venue, as well as any additional costs such as security or catering. {{ Budget }}
