## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**:  Please provide the paragraphs you would like me to revise.
**USER**: thank you for your time today, appreciated 
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for your valuable time today. I truly appreciate it.
**USER**: thank you for your time today, appreciated 
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I truly appreciate it.
**USER**: If that is weird hobby, i have one for you. I like to ask SDXL what it this some painters of past would imagine future to be.  Example. What would 16th century artist think of 25th century portrait?
**ASSISTANT**: If you find that hobby strange, let me share one with you. I have a fascination for exploring how artists from the past envisioned the future. For instance, I often wonder what a 16th-century artist would imagine a portrait in the 25th century to look like.
**USER**: apologies, just realised  neither of you was emailed report! 
**ASSISTANT**: Apologies for the oversight, but it seems that neither of you received the emailed report.
**USER**: Please go ahead and close this case and we will reopen it if issue is still there in next campaign 
**ASSISTANT**: Please proceed with closing this case, and if the issue persists in the next campaign, we can reopen it.
**USER**: looks like i've never emailed this , just created draft email. 
**ASSISTANT**: It appears that I never actually sent the email; I only created a draft. My apologies for the confusion.
**USER**: Thanks very much for keeping me updated, appreciated. Just quick check to see if you had any response from support after logging the ticket. I would like to include that in information I'm providing to Liz. 
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for keeping me informed. I greatly appreciate it. I just wanted to check if you received any response from the support team after logging the ticket. I would like to include that information in the update I'm providing to Liz.
**USER**: I have meeting with Liz on Monday  so would be good time to bring this up, No panic as meeting is in the afternoon. 
**ASSISTANT**: I have a meeting scheduled with Liz on Monday, which would be a good opportunity to discuss this matter. There's no need to panic, as the meeting is in the afternoon.
**USER**: thank you very much for the information provided. I understand data is going only one way which is good. I'm not quite clear on what exact data  will be uploaded to could and at what intervals 
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for your appreciation of the information provided. It's great to hear that the data is moving in a single direction, which is favorable. However, I would like to clarify the specifics regarding what exact data will be uploaded to the cloud and at what intervals.
**USER**: and what data is then pushed to mobile phone?
**ASSISTANT**: Additionally, I would like to clarify what specific data is pushed to the mobile phone from the cloud.
**USER**: could you please also ask vendor what happens to our data once the contract is finished? Can we download our data? Can data be deleted in the cloud when we don't need it anymore? 
**ASSISTANT**: Could you please inquire with the vendor regarding what happens to our data once the contract is finished? Specifically, I would like to know if we have the ability to download our data. Additionally, it would be helpful to understand if there is an option to delete data from the cloud when it is no longer needed.
**USER**: Thank you for quite a detailed information. I've reviewed documentation and I can see its different from what we originally discussed or maybe I didn't understand correctly some parts so its really good to have document like this 
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for your feedback and for reviewing the documentation. I understand that there may be some differences from what we initially discussed, or perhaps there were certain aspects that were not clear to you. Having a document like this is indeed beneficial for ensuring clarity and understanding.
**USER**: some questions i have . What happens to uploaded documents once they are turned into "chunks"? Are documents already available publicly? i just need to make sure there is no company-sensitive information .  Point is that GPT-4 will use and store questions and answers for further training and there are already cases where someone else data was exposed so this has to be treated as everything we say and search will be available in public domain 
**ASSISTANT**: I have a few questions regarding the process of uploading documents and their transformation into "chunks." Once the documents are turned into chunks, what happens to the original uploaded documents? Are they still accessible publicly in any way? I want to ensure that there is no company-sensitive information at risk.



Furthermore, I want to emphasize the importance of treating this data with utmost caution. Given that GPT-4 will utilize and store the questions and answers for training purposes, it is crucial to consider the potential risks. There have been instances where someone else's data was exposed, so we must approach this with the understanding that everything we say and search may become available in the public domain.
**USER**: and this brings me to my last point  - scope.  If we set this to use OpenAI GPT-3,5/4 and feed it documents that are already available on internet then we can never expand the scope to start expanding on our internal document m I think HR documentation was mentioned before as a potential candidate for this. 
**ASSISTANT**: I would like to address the point you raised about the scope of using OpenAI GPT-3,5/4 and the potential limitation it may impose. If we solely rely on feeding the model with documents already available on the internet, we may face challenges when expanding the scope to include our internal documents. As you mentioned, HR documentation was previously mentioned as a potential candidate for this application. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the scope and ensure that we have the flexibility to incorporate our internal documents in the future.
**USER**: if we are going to use at some point our own documents it would be worthwhile now in planning stage considering running local LLM
**ASSISTANT**: Considering our intention to incorporate our own documents into the system at some point, it would be worth considering the implementation of a local Language Model (LLM) during the planning stage. This would enable us to have more control over the training and utilization of the model, specifically tailored to our internal documents. It's a proactive approach that can ensure a seamless integration of our own data when the time comes.
**USER**: Not sure if you are aware of this or not. Just forwarding to you in case you are not in the loop 
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for forwarding the information. I appreciate your effort to keep me in the loop.
**USER**: write better: Not sure if you are aware of this or not. Just forwarding to you in case you are not in the loop 
**ASSISTANT**: I wanted to bring to your attention a matter that you may or may not be aware of. I am forwarding this information to you in case you are not already in the loop.
**USER**: since you are using AI model in your software , do you have AI policy and can I see it? 
**ASSISTANT**: As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific policies or documents, including OpenAI's internal policies. I can provide general information and assist with various topics, but for specific policies related to the software you are using, it would be best to reach out to the relevant support or legal team who can provide you with the AI policy or documentation you are seeking.
**USER**: write better: since you are using AI model in your software , do you have AI policy and can I see it?
**ASSISTANT**: Given that your software incorporates an AI model, I would like to inquire whether there is an established AI policy in place. If such a policy exists, I kindly request to review it for better understanding of the guidelines and principles governing the use of AI within your software.
