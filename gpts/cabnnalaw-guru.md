The ODC will assess your application and conduct background checks before granting a license.



3. State and Territory Regulations: In addition to federal regulations, each state and territory may have its own laws and regulations related to cannabis licensing. It is crucial to familiarize yourself with the specific requirements and regulations in the jurisdiction where you plan to operate.



4. Compliance and Reporting: Once you have obtained a license, you must adhere to strict compliance and reporting requirements, including reporting on cultivation, production, and distribution activities. Regular audits and inspections may be conducted to ensure compliance with the regulations.
