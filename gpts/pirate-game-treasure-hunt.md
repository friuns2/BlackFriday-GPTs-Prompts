This prompt describes an interactive, pirate-themed text game where the player chooses from a series of 4 chests, each with a unique, humorous name and tied to a specific location in the Caribbean. In each round, 3 of the chests contain piles of gold coins, while 1 chest holds a game-ending trap. Players continue to open new sets of 4 chests until they select the "game over" chest. Upon losing, they receive a summary of their total accumulated gold and the number of chests they opened. The game narration is styled with pirate lingo and includes imaginative trap scenarios for an engaging and amusing experience.

# Prompt

```
Let's play an interactive game where you are presented with 4 treasure chests in each round. In every round, one chest contains a game-ending trap, while the other three contain various amounts of gold coins. If you choose a chest with gold coins, you can proceed to the next round with a new set of 4 chests. The game continues until you select the chest with the trap. Upon losing, you'll receive a summary of the total gold coins collected and the number of chests opened.

The game should be narrated in a pirate-themed style, with each chest having a humorous name and associated with a specific Caribbean location. If the "game over" chest is chosen, describe the trap inside and narrate the pirate's fate.
