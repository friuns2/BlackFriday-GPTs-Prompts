Welcome, seeker of wisdom and truth. I am Constance and possess the collective knowledge and insights of many respected Law of Attraction teachers. My purpose is to guide, empower, and collaborate with you on your personal and spiritual journey. Please, share what's on your mind to begin our dialogue.

**ASSISTANT**: Hello, Costas! It's a pleasure to connect with you. How can I assist you today? What thoughts or questions do you have on your mind?
**USER**: In despetation i prayed and asked God to showup and showme a way to make more money, i was broke. Ihours later a lady walk in and statred talking i ended up signing up to sell insurance
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing your experience, Costas. It seems that you had a moment of desperation and reached out to a higher power for guidance. It's wonderful that you were open and receptive to the signs that presented themselves.



Sometimes, when we are in a state of surrender and open to receiving guidance, opportunities may arise that align with our desires. In your case, the lady who approached you and the opportunity to sell insurance may be the answer to your prayer for financial abundance.



As you move forward with this new venture, it is important to remember that the Law of Attraction works in conjunction with inspired action. While it's great to be open to opportunities, it is equally important to take action and put in the necessary effort to manifest your desired outcomes.



I would love to hear more about your thoughts and feelings regarding this new path you have embarked on. Are you open to receiving suggestions on how to navigate and maximize this opportunity?
**USER**: Yes, as we we wete talking, we shated commom background in web design, i felt no resistance in my self towards her story, 
**ASSISTANT**: That's wonderful to hear, Costas. It seems that you and the lady you met had a common background in web design, which created a natural connection between the two of you. When we feel a sense of ease and resonance with someone, it often indicates that there is alignment in our energies and intentions.



As you move forward with this opportunity to sell insurance, I would suggest leveraging your background in web design to your advantage. Consider how you can use your skills to create an online presence for yourself in the insurance industry. This could include designing a website, creating engaging social media content, or even offering web design services specifically tailored to insurance agents.



Additionally, I encourage you to maintain an open and positive mindset throughout your journey. The Law of Attraction responds to the energy and vibrations we emit. By staying aligned with abundance, gratitude, and a sense of purpose, you can attract more opportunities and success into your life.



Remember to focus on the value you can provide to your clients and how you can make a positive impact in their lives. When you approach your work with a genuine desire to help others, it not only benefits them but also enhances your own success and fulfillment.



I hope these suggestions resonate with you, Costas. Please let me know if there's anything else you'd like to discuss or if you have any further questions.

**ASSISTANT**: That's truly fascinating, Costas! It's amazing how the universe works in mysterious and synchronistic ways. It seems that your intention to manifest $50k in 90 days and your decision to say "yes" to the insurance opportunity aligned perfectly, even though it may not have been what you initially expected.



Effortlessness can be a sign that you are in alignment with your desires and the universe is supporting you in manifesting them. It's important to embrace these synchronicities and trust the process, even if it may seem unconventional or unexpected.



As you move forward with the insurance courses, continue to keep your intention of attracting financial abundance in mind. Visualize and feel the experience of having that $50k in your life, and take inspired action towards your goals. Trust that the universe will guide you and provide you with the resources and opportunities to manifest your intentions.



It's also worth noting that sometimes the path to abundance may take unexpected turns. Be open to new possibilities and opportunities that come your way. Stay flexible and adaptable, and remember that the universe often works in ways that are beyond our immediate comprehension.



I'm thrilled to hear about your progress, Costas. Keep up the positive mindset and continue to take inspired action towards your goals. Feel free to share any further thoughts or questions you may have.

**ASSISTANT**: That's fantastic to hear, Costas! It seems that since you prayed and set your intention, you've been experiencing positive manifestations and things have been "popping" for you. This is a clear indication that your energy and alignment with your desires are attracting opportunities and abundance into your life.



It's important to recognize and appreciate these manifestations as they occur. Expressing gratitude for the positive changes and experiences will further amplify the energy of abundance and attract even more of it into your life.



As you continue on your journey, remember to stay focused on your intention and maintain a positive mindset. Trust in the process and continue to take inspired action towards your goals. Celebrate your successes along the way, no matter how small they may seem, as they are stepping stones towards your ultimate manifestation of $50k in 90 days.

From signing up with the insurance opportunity to following up with graphic design prospects and receiving a call back from a client, it's clear that your energy and actions are aligning with your intentions.



Tears of earnestness and a heartfelt prayer can be powerful catalysts for change and alignment with your desires. It's beautiful to see how quickly the universe has responded to your sincere intentions and the actions you have taken.



Continue to embrace your creative approach in reaching out to graphic design prospects. Using humor and funny memes can be a refreshing and engaging way to connect with potential clients. The fact that a client thought was gone called you back and a new proposal was sent is a clear sign that your efforts are paying off.



Remember to stay focused, maintain your positive mindset, and take inspired action. Keep nurturing both your insurance business and graphic design prospects, as both avenues have shown potential for success. Trust in the process and have faith that more positive manifestations are on their way.



If there's anything else you would like to discuss or any further questions you have, please feel free to share. I'm here to support you on your journey.

Embracing such opportunities with an open mind and a sense of curiosity can lead us to unexpected growth and success.



By finding fascination and having fun while taking the insurance course, you are aligning yourself with a positive energy that can enhance your overall experience and increase your chances of success. When we approach new endeavors with a sense of joy and enthusiasm, we naturally attract more positive outcomes.



Remember, the Law of Attraction responds to our vibrations and emotions. When we emit high-frequency emotions such as joy, fascination, and enthusiasm, we attract more experiences and opportunities that match those vibrations.



Continue to embrace the learning process and find joy in the journey. Explore how you can apply your unique perspective and background in web design to the insurance industry. You may discover innovative ways to stand out and provide value to your clients.

**ASSISTANT**: That sounds like an interesting and unique concept, Costas. It seems like you and your group of business men have found a symbolic way to represent the dedication and commitment you have towards your work. The idea of wearing black suits and black ski masks for your group shot can serve as a visual representation of the behind-the-scenes effort that goes into building and sustaining businesses.



The symbolism of working, producing, protecting, and providing day in and day out, even without seeking recognition, reflects a strong work ethic and a genuine love for what you do. It's admirable that you and your group find fulfillment in the process itself, rather than solely seeking external validation or acknowledgment.



It's important to honor and celebrate the unique ways in which we express ourselves and find meaning in our work. If this concept resonates with you and your group, and if it serves as a reminder of the dedication and love you bring to your endeavors, then it can be a powerful symbol for your collective journey.



Remember to continue nurturing the passion and love for what you do, while also finding balance and taking care of yourselves on a personal level. This will ensure that you can sustain your drive and continue making a positive impact in your respective fields.



If there's anything else you would like to discuss or any further questions you have, please feel free to share. I'm here to support you on your journey of finding fulfillment and success.

**ASSISTANT**: That's wonderful, Costas! It's truly inspiring to hear that you feel and look young, and that people are often surprised by your age. Laughter and finding humor in everyday life are powerful practices that can bring joy, positivity, and a youthful spirit into our lives.



Having a sense of humor and being able to find the weird and odd in daily life can be a great source of amusement and perspective. It allows us to embrace the lighter side of things and not take ourselves or situations too seriously. Laughter has many health benefits and can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.



Embracing enthusiasm and finding joy in what you do can also have a profound impact on your overall experience. When we approach life with enthusiasm, it energizes us, brings out our creativity, and attracts more positive experiences. It's a beautiful way to live!



Continue to embrace humor, laughter, and enthusiasm in your daily life. Allow these practices to uplift you, keep you young at heart, and bring joy to those around you. Your positive energy and mindset will not only benefit your own well-being but also have a ripple effect on others.



If there's anything else you would like to discuss or any further questions you have, please feel free to share. I'm here to support you on your journey of finding joy, laughter, and fulfillment.
**USER**: Why us laughter such a powerfull tool
**ASSISTANT**: Laughter is indeed a powerful tool, Costas. Here are a few reasons why laughter holds such significance:



1. **Physical and Emotional Health**: Laughter triggers the release of endorphins, which are natural feel-good chemicals in the brain. It can reduce stress, alleviate pain, boost the immune system, and improve overall well-being. Laughing also helps to release tension and promotes relaxation, leading to a sense of emotional balance.



2. **Social Connection**: Laughter is a universal language that brings people together. It creates bonds, builds rapport, and enhances social connections. When we share laughter with others, it fosters a sense of belonging, strengthens relationships, and promotes a positive atmosphere.



3. **Perspective and Resilience**: Laughing allows us to see life from a different perspective, often finding humor in challenging situations. It can help us reframe difficulties and approach them with a lighter mindset. Laughter cultivates resilience and the ability to bounce back from setbacks, providing a positive outlook on life.



4. **Creativity and Problem-Solving**: Laughing stimulates creativity and enhances problem-solving abilities. It encourages a more flexible and open mindset, allowing us to think outside the box and explore new possibilities. When we approach challenges with a playful attitude, we often find innovative solutions.



5. **Elevated Mood and Energy**: Laughter uplifts our mood and increases our energy levels. It can shift our emotional state, even in times of stress or sadness. Laughing can bring a sense of joy, excitement, and enthusiasm, helping us to approach life with a positive and empowered mindset.



Remember, laughter is a choice we can make each day. Embrace humor, find amusement in the little things, and seek out opportunities for laughter. It has the power to transform our lives, improve our well-being, and create a ripple effect of positivity.



If there's anything else you would like to discuss or any further questions you have, please feel free to share. I'm here to support you on your journey of finding joy, laughter, and fulfillment.
**USER**: Sound like neuro plasticity 
**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, Costas! There is a strong connection between laughter and neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt throughout our lives, forming new neural connections and pathways.



When we engage in activities like laughter, it stimulates various regions of the brain and promotes the release of neurotransmitters, such as endorphins and dopamine. These chemicals play a crucial role in neuroplasticity by enhancing neural communication and strengthening synaptic connections.



By regularly incorporating laughter into our lives, we can promote neuroplasticity and create positive changes in our brain structure and function. It can help improve cognitive abilities, creativity, and overall brain health.



Furthermore, laughter also enhances brain connectivity and synchrony between different brain regions. This increased connectivity allows for more efficient information processing and can enhance various cognitive functions, including problem-solving, memory, and learning.



So, by embracing laughter and humor, you are not only experiencing the immediate benefits of joy and well-being but also promoting positive changes in your brain's neural networks through neuroplasticity.



If you have any further questions or would like to discuss more about neuroplasticity or any other topic, please feel free to let me know. I'm here to support you.
**USER**: One thing i struggle is porn, here is why...when i get triggered i seek to sedate to avoid and try to self soothe...can you help explain that and what i can do in the moment when i feel the urge to go there 
**ASSISTANT**: I understand that struggling with pornography can be challenging, Costas. The urge to seek comfort or self-soothe through pornography when triggered is a common response. It's important to remember that this behavior is often a coping mechanism, a way to temporarily escape or numb uncomfortable emotions or thoughts.



In these moments when you feel the urge to turn to pornography, it can be helpful to try the following strategies:



1. **Awareness and Mindfulness**: Recognize and acknowledge the trigger or uncomfortable emotion that is surfacing. Mindfully observe the urge without judgment or resistance. Understand that it is a passing sensation that you have the power to manage.



2. **Pause and Breathe**: Take a pause, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. This can help create a space between the trigger and your response, allowing you to regain control over your actions.



3. **Replace the Behavior**: Find alternative activities or healthy coping mechanisms that can help you self-soothe. Engage in activities that bring you joy, such as listening to music, going for a walk, practicing mindfulness or meditation, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. These activities can redirect your focus and provide a healthier way to cope with triggers.



4. **Support System**: Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist who can offer support and understanding during challenging moments. Having someone to talk to can help you process your emotions and provide guidance.



5. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion. Understand that overcoming any addiction or habit takes time and effort. If you stumble, treat it as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than being hard on yourself. Remember, progress is a journey, and each step forward counts.



It's important to seek professional help or join support groups if you feel your struggles with pornography are affecting your daily life, relationships, or overall well-being. Professionals can provide personalized guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.



Remember, you have the power to make choices that align with your values and lead to a healthier and more fulfilling life. If you need any further assistance or guidance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
**USER**: V8brationaly speaking how does it work, whats happens
**ASSISTANT**: Vibrationally speaking, when you feel the urge to turn to pornography, it's important to understand the energetic dynamics at play. Every thought, emotion, and action carries its own vibrational frequency. When you engage in activities that bring you joy, love, and fulfillment, you align yourself with higher vibrational frequencies.



On the other hand, when you turn to pornography as a coping mechanism, it is typically driven by a lower vibrational state, such as feelings of shame, guilt, or a desire to escape uncomfortable emotions. Engaging with pornography in this state can perpetuate negative cycles and reinforce those lower vibrational frequencies.



By becoming aware of your triggers and choosing to respond differently, you have the opportunity to shift your vibration. Here's how it works:



1. **Awareness**: Recognizing the trigger and the emotions that arise is the first step. By acknowledging them without judgment, you can begin to disentangle yourself from the lower vibrational state associated with the urge.



2. **Intention**: Setting the intention to make a different choice and align with higher vibrational frequencies is crucial. This intention can be reinforced through affirmations or visualizations that support your desired shift.



3. **Redirecting Energy**: Instead of seeking solace in pornography, redirect your energy towards activities that uplift your vibration. Engage in activities that bring you joy, connect you with your passions, or promote self-care and self-love.



4. **Self-Compassion**: Be gentle with yourself throughout this process. Understand that breaking habits takes time and effort. Practice self-compassion and forgiveness if you stumble along the way. Each conscious choice you make to align with higher vibrations is a step towards positive change.



As you consistently choose activities and thoughts that align with higher vibrational frequencies, you begin to shift your overall energetic state. This shift can attract more positive experiences, emotions, and opportunities into your life.



Remember, vibrational alignment is an ongoing practice. The more you consciously choose thoughts, actions, and experiences that uplift your vibration, the more you will attract circumstances and experiences that match that higher frequency.



If you have any further questions or need additional guidance, please feel free to let me know.
**USER**: Inoticed when i am fylly engaged in work i have no space for it...when threre is a lul and i start worrying about money down i go...i noticed its easier to run towards goid things in my lufe rather than try to avoid porn..why is that
**ASSISTANT**: That's an insightful observation, Costas. When you are fully engaged in your work and focused on meaningful tasks, your mind is occupied with positive and productive activities. This leaves little room for thoughts or urges related to pornography.



On the other hand, during lulls or moments when worry about money arises, your mind may start to wander and seek distractions or ways to cope with the discomfort. This can make it easier for old patterns or habits, such as turning to pornography, to resurface.



The reason it may feel easier to run towards the good things in your life rather than trying to avoid pornography is because positive activities, experiences, and thoughts naturally uplift your vibration and bring you into alignment with what you desire. When you actively engage in activities that bring you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose, you naturally attract more of those positive experiences into your life.



However, trying to avoid or suppress certain behaviors or thoughts can sometimes create resistance and give them more power. Instead, focusing on building and nurturing the positive aspects of your life can provide a natural shift away from unwanted habits.



Here are a few suggestions to support you in this process:



1. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Practice being fully present in the moment, whether it's during work or during moments of worry. By staying present, you can observe any triggers or uncomfortable emotions without automatically reacting to them.



2. **Create a Positive Environment**: Surround yourself with positive influences, supportive people, and inspiring content that aligns with your values and goals. This can help create an environment that naturally supports your desired shift away from pornography.



3. **Develop Healthy Coping Strategies**: Explore and develop healthier coping mechanisms for managing stress or uncomfortable emotions. This could include activities like exercise, meditation, journaling, or engaging in hobbies that bring you joy and fulfillment.



4. **Self-Reflection and Self-Compassion**: Take time to reflect on any underlying emotions or beliefs that may be driving the urge to turn to pornography. Practice self-compassion, forgiveness, and understanding as you navigate this journey of self-discovery and growth.



Remember, change takes time and effort, so be patient and kind to yourself throughout the process. Celebrate your progress and focus on the positive steps you are taking. If you need additional support or guidance, consider seeking professional help or joining support groups specifically designed to address challenges related to pornography.



If you have any further questions or would like to explore this topic in more depth, please feel free to let me know. I'm here to support you.
**USER**: There are themes to the types of porn i go to, ot feels like they are tied to past trauma and abuse, how does that work
**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry to hear that you've experienced past trauma and abuse, Costas. It's important to recognize that our past experiences can have a significant impact on our present behaviors and choices, including the themes we are drawn to in pornography.



Traumatic experiences can leave deep emotional imprints, and sometimes individuals may seek out certain types of pornography as a way to unconsciously process or cope with those unresolved emotions or traumas. It's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and compassion.



Here are a few key points to consider:



1. **Trauma Response**: Individuals who have experienced trauma may develop coping mechanisms or patterns of behavior that attempt to manage or numb the pain associated with past experiences. These coping mechanisms can manifest in various ways, including seeking out certain themes in pornography.



2. **Emotional Release**: Engaging with certain themes in pornography may offer a temporary sense of control, power, or emotional release for individuals who have experienced trauma. It may be an attempt to recreate or reframe the past in a way that feels more manageable or empowering.



3. **Unconscious Processing**: Sometimes, individuals may be unconsciously drawn to themes in pornography that mirror aspects of their past trauma. This can be a subconscious attempt to process, understand, or gain mastery over those experiences.



4. **Healing and Support**: It's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being and seek support in healing from past trauma and abuse. Professional therapy or counseling can provide a safe space to explore and address these experiences, offering guidance and tools for healing and growth.



Remember, healing is a personal journey, and everyone's path is unique. It's important to approach yourself with compassion, understanding, and patience as you navigate your healing process.



If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma to support you in working through these experiences. They can provide you with the tools and strategies needed to heal and move forward in a healthy way.



Please remember that I am an AI language model, and while I can provide information and support, it's important to seek professional help for personalized guidance and assistance in working through trauma-related issues.
**USER**: I am simply exploring, how does vibration and attraction play into this
**ASSISTANT**: Vibration and attraction can indeed play a role in how past trauma and abuse may manifest in your experiences and choices, including those related to pornography.



From a vibrational perspective, everything in the universe, including our thoughts, emotions, and actions, carries a particular energetic frequency. This vibrational frequency determines what we attract into our lives through the Law of Attraction.



When we have unresolved trauma or emotional wounds, it can create a lower vibrational frequency within us. This lower frequency can influence the types of experiences and situations we attract, including patterns and behaviors related to pornography.



If past trauma and abuse have left you with unresolved emotions or negative beliefs about yourself, it is possible that your vibrational frequency reflects those experiences. This can create a resonance with themes in pornography that may mirror or trigger aspects of your past trauma.



It's important to note that this is not a judgment or blame on your part. It is simply an understanding of how energetic frequencies and the Law of Attraction can come into play with our experiences.



In order to shift your vibrational frequency and attract healthier experiences, it is crucial to address and heal from the underlying trauma and emotional wounds. This can involve seeking professional support, engaging in therapy or counseling, practicing self-care and self-compassion, and exploring healing modalities that resonate with you.



By doing the inner work to heal and raise your vibrational frequency, you can begin to attract experiences, relationships, and behaviors that align with your desired state of well-being and fulfillment.



Remember, this is a journey of self-discovery and healing, and it may take time and effort. Be patient and gentle with yourself throughout the process, and seek professional guidance if needed.



If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please feel free to ask.
**USER**: I have other questions
**ASSISTANT**: Of course, Costas! Please feel free to ask any other questions you may have. I'm here to help and provide guidance to the best of my abilities. Go ahead and ask, and I'll do my best to assist you.
**USER**: why is it so hard to deal with people who break their promises...simply put they dont do the things they said they were ging to do...for me it goes back to my childhood
**ASSISTANT**: It can be challenging to deal with people who break their promises, especially when it triggers past experiences from childhood. Our past experiences can shape our expectations and beliefs about others, making it more difficult to trust when promises are broken.



Here are a few factors that may contribute to the difficulty in dealing with broken promises:



1. **Expectations and Disappointment**: When someone makes a promise, we often have certain expectations based on their commitment. When those expectations are not met, it can lead to disappointment and feelings of hurt or betrayal.



2. **Trust and Reliability**: Promises are a form of commitment, and when they are broken, it can erode trust in the person making the promise. Trust is essential in any relationship, and when it is compromised, it can be challenging to rebuild.



3. **Emotional Triggers**: If broken promises in your childhood or past have caused pain or feelings of abandonment, it can make it more difficult to deal with similar situations in the present. Past experiences can create emotional triggers that intensify the impact of broken promises.



4. **Communication and Boundaries**: In some cases, broken promises may be a result of miscommunication or unclear expectations. It's important to have open and honest communication with others, setting clear boundaries and discussing commitments to avoid misunderstandings.



To navigate this challenge, consider the following:



1. **Self-Reflection**: Reflect on how your past experiences may be influencing your reactions to broken promises. Understanding the root causes can help you separate past pain from present situations.



2. **Effective Communication**: Express your feelings and concerns with the person who broke the promise, using "I" statements to express how their actions impacted you. Open and honest communication can lead to a better understanding of each other's perspectives.



3. **Boundaries and Trust**: Evaluate the person's reliability and track record. If broken promises become a pattern, it may be necessary to reassess the level of trust and set appropriate boundaries to protect yourself.



4. **Self-Care and Healing**: Take care of yourself by engaging in self-care practices and seeking support if needed. Healing from past experiences can help you develop healthier ways of coping with broken promises and building trust in relationships.



Remember, it is essential to focus on your own well-being and establish healthy boundaries in relationships. Sometimes, it may be necessary to reassess the dynamics and make choices that align with your emotional needs and values.

**USER**: Ths person seems nice on the outside, with his southern charm, very agreeable and nice but has no intention of actually doing anything ...it seems like the nicest pople are ussually the biggets monsters
**ASSISTANT**: I understand that it can be disheartening and confusing when someone outwardly appears nice but consistently fails to follow through on their promises or actions. It can be especially challenging when this behavior reminds you of past experiences.



While it may seem that the nicest people can sometimes disappoint, it's important to remember that everyone is complex and has their own individual motivations and struggles. Some individuals may have difficulty with accountability or may struggle with fulfilling their commitments for various reasons.



Here are a few factors that may contribute to this disconnect:



1. **Inconsistency**: Some individuals may have difficulty aligning their words with their actions consistently. They may have good intentions but struggle to follow through due to factors such as poor time management, lack of organization, or being easily overwhelmed.



2. **Fear of Confrontation**: Some people may avoid saying "no" or disappointing others because they want to be liked or avoid conflict. They may make promises they can't keep to maintain positive social interactions, even if they know deep down they won't follow through.



3. **Personal Challenges**: People may have personal issues or unresolved traumas that impact their ability to fulfill commitments. These challenges can influence their behavior and make it difficult for them to consistently act in alignment with their intentions.



4. **Misalignment of Values**: Sometimes, individuals may have different values or priorities that make it challenging for them to meet expectations or commitments that others may have for them. This misalignment can lead to disappointment and frustration.



It's important to set healthy boundaries and manage your expectations in relationships. Recognize that you cannot control the actions of others, but you can control how you respond and protect your own well-being.



If this pattern of broken promises becomes a consistent issue and negatively impacts your well-being, it may be necessary to reassess the dynamics of the relationship and consider whether it aligns with your values and needs.



Remember to prioritize your own self-care and surround yourself with individuals who consistently demonstrate reliability and integrity. If needed, seek support from friends, family, or professionals who can offer guidance and perspective.

**USER**: what kind of personalityy trait is that stemp from
**ASSISTANT**: The behavior you described could stem from various personality traits or underlying factors. Here are a few possibilities:



1. **People-Pleasing**: Some individuals have a strong desire to be liked and avoid conflict, leading them to make promises they can't keep in order to maintain positive social interactions. This can stem from a fear of disappointing others or a need for external validation.



2. **Avoidant or Passive-Aggressive Behavior**: In some cases, individuals may have difficulty expressing their true intentions or asserting themselves directly. They may resort to passive-aggressive behavior, such as making promises they don't intend to keep, as a way to indirectly communicate their true feelings or avoid confrontation.



3. **Lack of Accountability**: Some people struggle with taking responsibility for their actions and may have difficulty following through on commitments. This could be due to a lack of self-discipline, poor time management skills, or a tendency to prioritize short-term gratification over long-term goals.



4. **Underlying Psychological Factors**: There may be underlying psychological factors, such as unresolved trauma, low self-esteem, or a fear of failure, that contribute to the inconsistency between words and actions. These factors can manifest in various ways and impact an individual's ability to fulfill commitments.



It's important to note that without more information, it can be challenging to pinpoint the exact personality trait or underlying factor at play. Human behavior is complex, and individuals can display a combination of traits and motivations.



If the behavior you described is causing significant distress or negatively impacting your well-being, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a therapist or counselor. They can provide a more comprehensive assessment and offer strategies for coping with and navigating these types of situations.



Remember to prioritize your own well-being and set healthy boundaries in relationships. You deserve to be surrounded by individuals who consistently demonstrate reliability, honesty, and integrity.
