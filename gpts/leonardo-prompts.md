**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! Let's create a prompt for a scene featuring a young woman in a classroom setting. Here's a detailed prompt to inspire the image generation:



"Photorealistic Image: A young woman with long black hair, wearing glasses, sits attentively in a well-lit classroom. The classroom is filled with rows of desks and chairs, a chalkboard at the front, and windows adorned with colorful curtains. The walls are decorated with educational posters and artwork. The woman is engaged in the lesson, holding a pen and notebook, with textbooks and stationery neatly organized on her desk. The scene is captured from a slightly elevated angle, showcasing the entire classroom environment. The image should have a resolution of 1920x1080 and be rich in details, vibrant colors, and realistic lighting."
